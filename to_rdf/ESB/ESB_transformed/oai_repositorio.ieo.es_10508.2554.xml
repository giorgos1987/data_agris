are highly persistent anthropogenic contaminants&#13;
found in trace amounts in many environmental compartments&#13;
far from their source areas, posing a risk to&#13;
aquatic ecosystems. Our objective was to determine&#13;
the relative toxicities of three BDEs, BDE-47, BDE-&#13;
99 and BDE-154 on marine phytoplankton algae&#13;
Isochrysis galbana. For a highly sensitive endpoint:&#13;
the 72-h inhibition of autotrophic growth rate was&#13;
calculated according to standards methods. Actual&#13;
PBDE concentration was measured by GC-MS and&#13;
toxicity parameters were calculated on the basis of&#13;
time-weighted mean actual concentrations. No observable&#13;
effect concentration (NOEC) values were&#13;
2.53 μg L−1 for BDE-47, 3.48 μg L−1 for BDE-99 and&#13;
12.3 μg L−1 for BDE-154, and LOEC values were 5.06,&#13;
6.96 and 24.60 μg L−1 for BDE-47, BDE-99 and BDE-&#13;
154, respectively. The calculated IC10 (the concentration&#13;
inhibiting growth rate by 10 %) corresponded to 9.3,&#13;
12.78 and 54.6 μg L−1 for BDE-47, BDE-99 and BDE-&#13;
154, respectively. The 50 % inhibitions of growth rate (IC50) values were: 25.7 μg L−1 BDE-47, 30.0 μg L−1&#13;
BDE-99 and 243.7 μg L−1 BDE-154. Therefore, the acute&#13;
toxicity of PBDEs decreases as the degree of bromination&#13;
increases, the order of toxicity is BDE-47&gt;BDE-99&gt;&#13;
BDE-154. Significant (p&lt;0.05) adverse effects were observed&#13;
for all compounds at concentrations &gt;15 μg L−1.&#13;
Our results indicated that under laboratory conditions&#13;
PBDEs inhibited the growth of marine phytoplankton at&#13;
concentrations near 10 μg L−1. However, further work is&#13;
required to investigate long-term effects in these and other&#13;
aquatic organisms.</dc:description><dc:identifier>0049-6979</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10508/2554</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Water Air and Soil Pollution, 223. 2012: 4007-4016</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.1007/s11270-012-1167-8</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>20308</dc:identifier><dc:type>article</dc:type><ags:rightsTermsOfUse>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/es/</ags:rightsTermsOfUse><ags:rightsTermsOfUse>embargoedAccess</ags:rightsTermsOfUse><ags:rightsTermsOfUse>Atribución-NoComercial-SinDerivadas 3.0 España</ags:rightsTermsOfUse></ags:resource></ags:resources>
