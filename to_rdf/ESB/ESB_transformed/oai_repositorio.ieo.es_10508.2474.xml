Total mean catches, biomass and mean numbers for yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea) are presented for the period 1995-2013, for redfish (Sebastes spp) for the period 1997-2013 and for witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus) for the period 2002-2013. Detailed indices are presented from 2009. Yellowtail flounder does not show a clear trend since 1998; its indices are almost constant throughout this period, with a slight increase in the last five years. Redfish indices oscillate greatly over time, probably because the gear does not sample adequately aggregating pelagic species. There was a sharp increase in 2009, being more or less stable since then at a high level, comprising the 3N around the 90% of the total biomass in last years. Good year classes have not been registered recently. Witch flounder is very scarce and also lacks a clear trend in the data series, being the values always poor. Recruitment was quite good at the beginning of the series but very poor in recent years.</dc:description><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10508/2474</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Consejo Científico de NAFO.
