It is well known that estrogens have an immune-modulatory role, and&#13;
some evidence exists that neutrophil physiology can be altered by these molecules. Traditionally, estrogens act via classical nuclear&#13;
estrogen receptors, but the identification of a G protein–coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), a membrane estrogen receptor that&#13;
binds estradiol and other estrogens, has opened up the possibility of exploring additional estrogen-mediated effects. However,&#13;
information on the importance of GPER for immunity, especially, in neutrophils is scant. In this study, we report that gilthead&#13;
seabream (Sparus aurata L.) acidophilic granulocytes, which are the functional equivalent of mammalian neutrophils, express&#13;
GPER at both mRNA and protein levels. By using a GPER selective agonist, G1, it was found that GPER activation in vitro slightly&#13;
reduced the respiratory burst of acidophilic granulocytes and drastically altered the expression profile of several genes encoding&#13;
major pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators. In addition, GPER signaling in vivo modulated adaptive immunity. Finally, a cAMP&#13;
analog mimicked the effects of G1 in the induction of the gene coding for PG-endoperoxide synthase 2 and in the induction of CREB&#13;
phosphorylation, whereas pharmacological inhibition of protein kinase A superinduced PG-endoperoxide synthase 2. Taken together,&#13;
our results demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that estrogens are able to modulate vertebrate granulocyte&#13;
functions through a GPER/cAMP/protein kinase A/CREB signaling pathway and could establish therapeutic targets for several&#13;
immune disorders in which estrogens play a prominent role.
