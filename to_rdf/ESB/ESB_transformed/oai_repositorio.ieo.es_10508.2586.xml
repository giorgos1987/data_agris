framework of the Canary Islands Government and UE PCT MAC 2007-2013 programmes respectively.&#13;
Research has mainly focused on the stock assessment of the striped soldier shrimp, Plesionika edwardsii&#13;
(Brandt, 1851), because it has shown moderate to high levels of fishing yield and abundances compatible&#13;
with the development of a new sustainable fishery in the Cape Verde Islands.&#13;
Cruises took place on board the R/V Prof. Ignacio Lozano. Four 15-day surveys have been conducted to&#13;
date: Cabo Verde 2010-04 (April 2010), Camar˜ao-1 (November 2011), Camar˜ao-2 (Mars 2012) and Camar&#13;
˜ao-3 (July 2012). An innovative fishing gear so-called multiple semi-floating shrimp trap (MSFST)&#13;
was used. Each fishing line was composed by 40-65 traps operating around 2.4 m above the seafloor,&#13;
using Decapterus macarellus (Carangidae) as unique bait of the traps. Fishing depth was 66-458 m, and&#13;
efective fishing time was 16-18 h. Each trap was attached to the main bottom line every 15 m, and the&#13;
maximum attraction of this bait was established to be 100 or 150 m, according to the experience gained&#13;
from the local fishery for deep-sea lobsters. So density by area was calculated assuming two different&#13;
areas of attraction of the fishing gear. Initial biomass was estimated from depletion experiments at different&#13;
abundance stations by applying the Leslie &amp; Davis (1939) method, modified by Ricker (1975). Each&#13;
fishing operation was classified according to its yield (CPUE in g/trap/night). The potential fishing planar&#13;
area was estimated between the isobathymetric lines between 90 and 220 m. Total biomasses (Bt) were&#13;
calculated from areas (km2) and mean minimum/maximum densities (kg/km2). Maximum sustainable&#13;
yield (MSY) was estimated from Bt using the Beddington and Cooke (1983) model by entering natural&#13;
mortality (0.6), growth rate (0.53 year&#1048576;�1) and recruitment age (1.32 year), which are the parameters for&#13;
this target species published for the Canaries. These parameters estimate a biological exploitation rate&#13;
( ) of 0.262. Interpolations were applied to estimate MSY for insular stocks representing lesser than 5%&#13;
of the total fishing grounds for this species in the archipelago.&#13;
The MSY estimated by depletion were 30.5 tons/year for the stock of S˜ao Vicente, Santa Luzia, Ilheus&#13;
and S˜ao Nicolau, 10 tons/year for the stock of Santiago, 138.8 tons/year for the stock of Boa Vista&#13;
and Maio, and 5.6 tons/year for the stock of Sal. The small stocks estimated by interpolation were:&#13;
4.5 tons/year for the stock of Santo Ant˜ao, 1.3 tons/year for the stock of Fogo, and 1.8 tons/year for&#13;
the stock of Brava and Ilheus. In total, 192.5 tons per year was the total MSY for the striped soldier&#13;
shrimp around the islands of the Cape Verde archipelago, occupying a total area of 1,918 km2 of new&#13;
fishing grounds at between 90 and 220 m of depth. In comparison with the traditional bottom trap&#13;
used in the Canary Islands, the innovative fishing gear MSFST were proved to be more selective for&#13;
pandalid shrimps, minimizing the gear impact on the seafloor as well as the by-catch by reducing the&#13;
discards. Depletion methods are based on the assumption of a closed system, that is with minimum or&#13;
zero immigration between neighbouring areas. The straight forward decline of CPUEs obtained during&#13;
the depletion experiments seems to confirm that P. edwardsii is a low mobility species, making this&#13;
assumption valid at least during short-time periods. Because of the bathymetry profile of these islands,the depth range is from very close (few nautical miles in Santiago) to far away (10-12 n.m. in Boa Vista)&#13;
to the coastline.&#13;
Fishing effort should be controlled on the basis of quotas, number of fishing vessels and a precautionary&#13;
approach in order to ensure that catching is commensurate with sustainable levels of exploitation. MSY&#13;
estimates suggest that this new Capeverdean fishery should be carried out by specialized medium-sized&#13;
fishing vessels. During the last decades a combination of shrimp trawling and industrial trapping activity&#13;
has threatened over-exploitation in the Mediterranean fisheries targeting on P. edwardsii; currently the&#13;
shrimp collapse has conducted to the decline of these fisheries. Can the Cape Verde regulatory bodies&#13;
and all the stakeholders involved learn the lessons this teaches us about this resource management?</dc:description><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10508/2586</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>IV International Symposium of Marine Sciencies.
