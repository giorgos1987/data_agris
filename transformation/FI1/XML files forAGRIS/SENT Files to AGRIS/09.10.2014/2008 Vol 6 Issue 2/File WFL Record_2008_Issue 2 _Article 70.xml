    <abstract>Seasonal variation on flower production in imported rose (Rosa indica) varieties was studied under greenhouse conditions in Kuwait. The study focused on testing the fluctuations in quantity and quality of rose flowers produced during summer and winter months. Ten cultivars of cut flower rose procured from Netherlands were selected for the experiment. The selection was based on the morphological characters and flowering pattern. Plants were planted in ten gallon pots filled with a mixture of potting soil: perlite: peat moss in the ratio of 1:1:2. Data was collected on the number of flowers produced during the months of May 2006 to April 2007. Results showed highly significant difference between the number of flowers produced during summer and winter months in all the cultivars. The number of flowers and flower quality was highest during the months of September and October. The yield reduction during winter months was directly related to lower temperature inside the closed environment which resulted in reduction in flowering shoots production.</abstract>
