from seven areas of the N–NW Spanish coast, during the period 1991–2009. The studied area&#13;
is comprised of highly productive ecosystems which support important commercial fishing and shellfishing&#13;
activities. The seven PCBs indicator congeners recommended by ICES (IUPAC nos. 28, 52, 101, 118,&#13;
138, 153 and 180), were analysed by gas chromatography with an electron capture detector (GC-ECD).&#13;
Lowest average concentrations of PCBs were recorded in Arousa (1.04 µg kg- 1 wet weight), a low populated&#13;
area with no industry; while the highest levels were found in areas near cities and/or showing a&#13;
high industrial activity such as: Bilbao Ziérbena (139 µg kg -1 ww) or A Coruña (55 µg kg -1 ww). The&#13;
hexachlorinated congeners CB153 and CB138 dominated the profiles in all wild mussel populations,&#13;
although a geographical pattern was found in which the relative contributions of the lower chlorinated&#13;
congeners were higher in the west coast (Rías of Vigo, Pontevedra and Arousa), which may reflect the&#13;
occurrence of recent inputs of those compounds in the area. Finally, the application of the Mann–Kendall’s&#13;
test demonstrate the existence of a significant decrease in PCBs levels since 1991 up to 1996 in&#13;
the studied area, whereas either a slow decrease or stable concentrations were registered over the past&#13;
decade.</dc:description><dc:identifier>0045-6535</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10508/2517</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Chemosphere, 85. 2011: 533-541</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.08.017</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>20293</dc:identifier><dc:type>article</dc:type><ags:rightsTermsOfUse>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/es/</ags:rightsTermsOfUse><ags:rightsTermsOfUse>embargoedAccess</ags:rightsTermsOfUse><ags:rightsTermsOfUse>Atribución-NoComercial-SinDerivadas 3.0 España</ags:rightsTermsOfUse></ags:resource></ags:resources>
