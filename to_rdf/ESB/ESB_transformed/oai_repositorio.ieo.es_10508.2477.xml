Dinophysis sacculus are reported throughout their cellular division phases (cytokinesis, and sulcal list&#13;
regeneration) in 5 in situ cell cycle studies in the Punic harbors of Carthage (northern Tunisia). Two types&#13;
of deformation were observed: invaginations in the ventral and dorsal margin and protuberances at the&#13;
base of the left sulcal list. No virus or bacteria were detected with Syber green stain. In situ division rates&#13;
(m) varied among seasons and stations for the same species. D. acuminata exhibited moderate&#13;
(0.22 day 1) to high (0.68 day 1) m rates which were however very low (0.02–0.17 day 1) for D. sacculus&#13;
in autumn and moderate (0.21–0.35 day 1) in late spring. In 2009 the seasonal distribution of Dinophysis&#13;
indicates maximum Dinophysis cf. ovum abundance in March and a high number of D. acuminata in early&#13;
June, while in 2010 maximum abundance of the same species was found in mid-June.&#13;
Molecular and genetic studies and staining with specific fluorescent strains should be addressed to&#13;
hopefully explain these Dinophysis cell deformations during their in situ division.</dc:description><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10508/2477</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Harmful Algae, 39. 2014: 191-201</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.1016/j.hal.2014.07.017</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>20266</dc:identifier><dc:type>article</dc:type><ags:rightsTermsOfUse>embargoedAccess</ags:rightsTermsOfUse></ags:resource></ags:resources>
