    <abstract>The aim of the study was to investigate of the possibility of second production in a year from Rock partridges. In the study, 12 male and 48 female partridges at 32 weeks of age were used. The partridges were mated in cages at the ratio of 1 male:4 female. Appropriate lighting regime (16 light:8 dark) was applied to partridges at 58 weeks of age to obtain second production in a year. Egg production, fertility, hatchability, hatchability of fertile eggs in the first and second periods of partridges were determined to be 51.55 and 42.80 egg/hen, 83.34 and 75.73 %, 66.89 and 59.80 %, 80.18 and 80.22 % respectively. It was determined that there were significantly differences among egg production (P&lt;0.001) for the first and the second period. But differences between the others characters were not significant. As a result of this study, It was concluded that production characteristics of partridges could be increased via forced molting; however a suitable programme should be developed respecting animal welfare. In this way, more economically partridge breeding can be done.</abstract>
