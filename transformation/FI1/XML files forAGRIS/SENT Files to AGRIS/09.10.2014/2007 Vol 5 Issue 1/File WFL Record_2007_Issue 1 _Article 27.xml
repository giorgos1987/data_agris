    <abstract>Kenaf is a rapidly growing annual crop that is cultivated mainly for its stem with numerous end uses (paper, insulation mats, oil/chemical absorbent, energy production, etc.). The growth and adaptability of several varieties have already been tested in central Greece for the period 1994-1997. This specific work aimed to evaluate the effect of variety (Tainung 2, Mal 1, Everglades 41), plant density (32 and 17 plants/m2) and irrigation (100 and 60% of PET) on growth and dry yields of kenaf in north-east Greece (Komotini). After three years of experimentation (1997-1999), it was found that the most productive variety of the three was Tainung 2 with mean peak dry stem yields of 21 t/ha, followed by Mal 1 (19 t/ha) and Everglades 41 (16.7 t/ha). At the same time the mean dry stem yield in the plots with high density was 19.4 t/ha, while in the ones with the low density 18.1 t/ha. Almost the same dry stem yields were recorded for the two irrigation rates with yields of 19.5 t/ha (100% of PET) and 18.1 (60 % of PET). At that time the bark content on dry basis was 39% for Tainung 2, 40% for Mal 1 and 41% for Everglades 41 and the moisture content of the stem was 58%. When the harvesting was postponed 50-60 days after reaching the highest dry stem yields, the moisture content of the harvested material was reduced from 58 to 25% but at the same time the dry yields were reduced 27% (from 18.8 to 13.6 t/ha) and the bark content was 35%, averaged overall treatments.</abstract>
