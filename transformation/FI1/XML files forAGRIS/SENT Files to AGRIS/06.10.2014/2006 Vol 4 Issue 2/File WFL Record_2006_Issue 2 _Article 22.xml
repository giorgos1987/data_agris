    <abstract>Studies were conducted to determine the optimum setting point conditions in the production of tamarind cheese and to subsequently investigate the effects of this matrix on the physicochemical, sensory and microbiological quality attributes of tamarind cheese during refrigerated storage. Optimum setting point conditions were achieved at a pH of 2.5 when the tamarind pulp was mixed with a 3% pectin solution and 20% fructose corn syrup at a Brix of 70° at an end point boiling temperature of 105°C. Tamarind cheese made with fructose corn syrup at a pH of 2.5 had the best sensory quality ratings. Samples remained stable irrespective of the use of the preservative potassium sorbate as scores for flavour, titratable acidity and overall acceptability remained unchanged for samples stored up to 28 days at 10°C. On the other hand samples with fructose corn syrup at a pH of 3.0 were generally softer, not as flavourful, more acidic and significantly lower in acceptability rating compared to samples at a pH of 2.5. For all treatments microbial counts and colour change were negligible for the entire duration of refrigerated storage.</abstract>
