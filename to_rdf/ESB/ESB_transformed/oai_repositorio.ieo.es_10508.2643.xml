larvae sampled in their Balearic Sea spawning grounds&#13;
during the 2003–2005 spawning seasons was examined.&#13;
Multi-factorial ANOVA was applied to study&#13;
the effects of environmental variables, such as temperature&#13;
at 10 m depth (T10), microzooplankton dry&#13;
weight (MDW) and protein/dry weight ratio (PROT/&#13;
MDW) on larval growth. The 2003 bluefin tuna&#13;
(BFT) larval cohort showed the fastest growth, recognizable&#13;
from enhanced otolith and somatic mass increment&#13;
compared to the 2004–2005 larval cohorts. The&#13;
2003 BFT larvae showed greater recent growth than&#13;
the 2004–2005 BFT cohorts, which decreased in the&#13;
last stages of development. Growth differences&#13;
between the 2004 and 2005 larval cohorts were not&#13;
significant. The environmental conditions between&#13;
2003 and 2004–2005 were highly contrasting as a&#13;
result of the 2003 warming anomaly. Somatic and otolith&#13;
growth rates (OGR) were significantly related to&#13;
T10 and MDW, as well as to the PROT/MDW ratios.&#13;
Nonetheless, the effect of T10 on OGR depended on&#13;
the relative high (H) or low (L) levels of MDW and&#13;
PROT/DW. Higher OGR was observed when T10 was&#13;
high, MDW was low and PROT/DW was high. This&#13;
environmental scenario conditions were met during&#13;
2003, which recorded the highest surface temperature&#13;
and low planktonic biomass. Somatic growth,expressed as larval DW growth increase (DWGR),&#13;
showed three-factor significant interactions with&#13;
T10*MDW*PROT/MDW, in which the two-way&#13;
interactions of MDW*PROT/MDW showed differences&#13;
in the function of T10 levels.</dc:description><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10508/2643</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Climate-induced environmental conditions influencing interannual variability of Mediterranean bluefin (Thunnus thynnus) larval growth, 22(4). 2013: 273-287</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>doi:10.1111/fog.12021</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>20394</dc:identifier><dc:type>article</dc:type><ags:rightsTermsOfUse>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/es/</ags:rightsTermsOfUse><ags:rightsTermsOfUse>restrictedAccess</ags:rightsTermsOfUse><ags:rightsTermsOfUse>Atribución-NoComercial-SinDerivadas 3.0 España</ags:rightsTermsOfUse></ags:resource></ags:resources>
