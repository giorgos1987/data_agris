and the subsequent establishment of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, leading to a relative thermal and&#13;
biogeographic isolation of the Antarctic fauna. However, the zoogeographical affinities of several taxa from&#13;
South America and Antarctica have been subject to debate, bringing into question the extent of Antarctic&#13;
isolation.Herewe present newdata on bryozoan species and their spatial distribution in the Argentine Patagonian&#13;
(AP) region, as well as an analysis of the bryozoological similarities between deep ranges from Argentina and&#13;
neighboring regions. A total of 108 species of cheilostome bryozoans (378 samples), belonging to 59 genera&#13;
was found. Five new genera and 36 new species were found in the AP region, while 71 species were reported&#13;
for the first time from Argentina. The bathymetric ranges of 94 species (87%) were expanded and a high&#13;
proportion of the identified species (44.4%) also had an Antarctic distribution. The bryozoological affinities&#13;
found in the current study between the nearest geographical neighbors are in agreement with the hypothesis&#13;
of the sequential separation of Gondwana during the Cenozoic. Moreover, a high number of shared species,&#13;
mainly from the slope, were found in this study between the AP region and Antarctica, thus supporting the&#13;
idea that the Southern Ocean may have been less isolated over geological time than once thought.</dc:description><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10508/2658</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Journal of Sea Research, 85. 2013: 1-17</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.1016/j.seares.2013.09.003</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>20406</dc:identifier><dc:type>article</dc:type><ags:rightsTermsOfUse>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/es/</ags:rightsTermsOfUse><ags:rightsTermsOfUse>closedAccess</ags:rightsTermsOfUse><ags:rightsTermsOfUse>Atribuci칩n-NoComercial-SinDerivadas 3.0 Espa침a</ags:rightsTermsOfUse></ags:resource></ags:resources>
