The system was composed by a 10x20 38 K cycles ceramic transducer attach to a platform floating in the center of the cage and connect to a transceiver. Data were stocked in a laptop. Energy for all the system was provide by two batteries. All these devices were located into an hermetic stainless steel box fixed on the external ring of the cage. Daily, in the morning, the system was stopped and data were downloaded The monitoring period was between February and April 2005. Tunas were fed with raw fish once a day, over 10:00 in the morning. The mean water temperature was 13.3 ºC. No termocline was observed in this period. Binary data provided by the transceiver, in daily files were visualized with the Sonar Data Echoview® (SonarData Pty Ltd, GPO Box 1387 Hobart, Tasmania, Australia</dc:description><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10508/1009</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>European Aquaculture Society Special Publication 35:171-172</dc:identifier><ags:rightsTermsOfUse>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/es/</ags:rightsTermsOfUse><ags:rightsTermsOfUse>Atribución-NoComercial-SinDerivadas 3.0 España</ags:rightsTermsOfUse></ags:resource></ags:resources>
