								<abstract language="eng">Villa Rica is one of the most important coffee-producing districts in Peru. In Villa Rica there are several marketing channels: intermediaries, private companies, cooperatives and associations. The intermediaries focus solely on higher prices while marketing organizations offer benefits to their members. The main aim of this paper is to analyze the socio-economic characteristics that influence coffee farmers to join a formal organization vs. those who distribute their product through intermediaries. A survey of 60 producers was carried out in June 2011 in Villa Rica. A binary logistic model was used in order to show how these characteristics affect farmers’ choice of which marketing channel to use to distribute their product. The results demonstrated that farmers who are keen to receive technical assistance participate in the marketing organizations. These coffee marketing organizations should look for ways to improve the extension component through training and knowledge transfers to smallholder farmers.</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">Blueberry wines may have a multitude of health benefits, but few studies have quantified the health-enhancing antioxidants, total phenols, anthocyanins and flavonoids in blueberry wines, especially the Southern highbush blueberry wine, in comparison to grape wines and fruit liquors. This study was initiated to fill such a gap by measuring the antioxidant capacity and key phytonutrients of Southern highbush blueberry wine as compared to red, Rose and white wines and fruit liquors. The Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) of the Southern highbush blueberry wine tested in this study ranged from 18.54 to 25.48 mmol TE/L, with an average of 22.57 ± 2.92 mmol TE/L. This was higher than the ORAC values of over 80% of the red wines and 100% of the Rose and white wines reported in literature. A majority of the red wines were higher, but all the Rose and white wines and most fruit liquors were lower in total phenolic content than the Southern highbush blueberry wine. Anthocyanin contents of the blueberry wines were generally comparable to those of the red wines. Results show that blueberry wines could be more potent than most red, Rose and white wines in health enhancement and disease prevention from the antioxidant perspective.</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">The use of chemical insecticides in the control of insect pests has left in its wake resistance of some pests to some of the conventional insecticides. Alternative methods of managing pests such as cultural control have to be employed to reduce pest infestation of crops. Onion was used in an intercrop as a non host crop to manage the pests of cabbage. The experiment was conducted in a Randomized Complete Block Design with four treatments; sole cabbage (T1), 2 rows of cabbage to 1 row of onion (T2), 3 rows of cabbage to 1 row of onion (T3) and 4 rows of cabbage to 1 row of onion (T4), each of which was replicated three times. Data were collected on pests’ numbers, plant height, damaged leaves at harvest, canopy spread, number of damaged heads and fresh weight. Significantly fewer &lt;em&gt;Bemisia tabaci, Hellula undalis&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Brevicoryne brassicae&lt;/em&gt; infested the intercropped plants than the sole crop. However, intercropping cabbage with onion did not significantly reduce &lt;em&gt;Plutella xylostella&lt;/em&gt; population on cabbage. Number of damaged heads, fresh weight and damaged leaves were significantly different (P&amp;lt; 0.05).</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">Knowledge transfers from the public to the private sector about the substance and necessity of regulatory rules are critical for effective regulatory compliance. With groups of professionals that share specialized training the overall problems are minimized. Yet what happens when regulators contend with non-professionals? Using a case of forestry policy in Washington State we find that professional-to-professional exchanges are relatively effective, but that non-professional forest owners were less responsive, which reduced the effectiveness of the knowledge transfer and program compliance. We also find that one way to overcome this implementation barrier is to have regulators use an adult-based learning method.</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">The forestry-livestock waste materials represent a serious ecological problem if they are not handled properly in agricultural activities. Vermicomposting is a biotechnological process with potential to transform such materials into products that can be safely used as soil enhancers. The objective of this study was to evaluate the nutritional characteristics of organic fertilizers obtained from forestry-livestock organic waste materials when they are processed through vermicomposting using “Red Californian Earthworm” (&lt;em&gt;Eisenia fetida&lt;/em&gt;). A completely randomized experimental design with four treatments and eight replicates was performed. Treatments (mixtures) included: leaf litter + sawdust (LS), bovine manure + sawdust (BS), rabbit manure + sawdust (RS), and ovine manure + sawdust (OS). Total nitrogen, pH, carbon/nitrogen ratio, organic carbon and nitrates from vermicompost samples were measured and statistically analyzed using SAS v8.2. At the end of the study, all mixtures showed similar characteristics according to the analyzed variables. Carbon/nitrogen ratios decreased in three mixtures to values considered as within the vermicompost maturity stage. Contents of nitrates and total nitrogen were increased. Final pH showed statistical difference among all mixtures. Results indicate that vermicomposting is a viable process for recycling forestry-livestock organic waste materials since it improves their chemical and nutritional characteristics.</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">The Garhwal Himalaya represents a traditional agricultural society where more than 74% population largely depends on the cultivation of subsistence cereal crops to run their livelihood. Over the time, with the increase in human population and decrease in per capita land, the traditional subsistence agriculture could not fulfill food requirement. This was resulted in food insecurity and thus agricultural diversification began with the cultivation of cash crops - fruits, off-season vegetables and also of medicinal plants. Although, agro-ecological condition favours diversification of crops and agro-biodiversity is very high in the Garhwal region, the pace of diversifying cash crops for commercialization is tremendously low. Diversity in crops varies spatially - horizontal and vertical and temporally - rabi and kharif seasons. The highlands characterize high agro-biodiversity in comparison to the mid-slopes and the valley regions. Crop diversification index (CDI) of cereals and cash crops was calculated separately from the secondary dada. A case study of six villages was done to calculate cost-benefit analysis of cereals and cash crops. The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential of diversification – cereals as well as cash crops for livelihood sustainability in the Garhwal Himalaya</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">Many commercial cowpea farmers control insect pests on cowpea with synthetic chemicals and may sometimes spray their farms during the growing season as many as 8 to 10 times. This leads to health hazards and environmental pollution. The present study was conducted to reduce the number of times, cypermethrin (conventional chemical) is applied before harvest and still, produce the expected cowpea grains. The experiments were carried out in two agro-ecological zones - Asaba and Abraka of Delta State during the late cropping season. The experiments consisted of 4 treatments - cowpea plots sprayed 4 times (at 7 days’ intervals), cowpea plots sprayed 5 times (at 10 days’ intervals), cowpea plots whose insect infestation were monitored before chemical application and control plots (without chemical treatment). Each treatment was replicated 3 times. The experiments were organised into a randomised complete block design (RCBD). The results indicated that cypermethrin controlled the major insect pests of cowpea.  Second, grain yield was high at both locations; significant differences did not exist (P&amp;gt;0.05) in insect number and grain yield among the treatments. The study provides the evidence that (i) high cowpea grain yield is obtained at reduced number of chemical application of 4 or 5 times during the growing season (ii) Grain yield was significantly (P&amp;lt;0.05) higher at Abraka with1400.60kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; than Asaba (714.40kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) during the late cropping season.</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">Technical efficiency analysis has a vital role in fishing management and decommissioning programs. In this context, ignoring the variation across the regions in the field of natural endowment and level of economic development may lead to biased estimates of efficiency scores. Therefore, efficiency analysis in the southern coastal provinces of Iran, which is the aim of this study, was investigated by a common metafrontier production function that was identical for all studied provinces. The required data was obtained from a random sample of 520 fishery vessels. The results of the estimating metafrontier showed that mean technical efficiency for selected provinces varies between 0.408 and 0.542, while ranging between 0.650 and 0.728 when assessed based on the regional frontier. The highest mean technical efficiency based on metafrontier is devoted to Sistan-va-Baluchestan, while Bushehr has the lowest mean technical efficiency. The results also indicated that the main reasons, beyond the fact that Sistan-va-Baluchestan has the highest technical operation in comparison with other provinces are access to more suitable vessels and especially, access to the deeper water in the Oman Sea and Indian Ocean to fish the big pelagic species.</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">Adoption of the cocoa (&lt;em&gt;Theobroma cacao&lt;/em&gt;) production technologies recommended to cocoa farmers by Cocoa Research Institute of Ghana (CRIG) had been low, leading to yield and production levels below potential. To investigate this issue, a formal socio-economic sample survey of 300 cocoa farmers selected randomly, by a multi-stage sampling technique, from all the cocoa growing regions of Ghana was conducted with a structured questionnaire for the individual interviews. The adoption rates of CRIG-recommended technologies such as control of capsids with insecticides, control of black pod disease with fungicides, weed control manually or with herbicides, planting hybrid cocoa varieties and fertilizer application were 10.3%, 7.5%, 3.7%, 44.0% and 33.0%, respectively. Adoption models indicated that credit, number of cocoa farms owned by the farmer, gender, age of the cocoa farm, migration, cocoa farm size, and cocoa yield affected the adoption decisions of cocoa farmers concerning the CRIG-recommended technologies analyzed in this study.</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">This discourse discusses communication as a potent sociological tool for rural and agricultural development. It demystifies the concepts of communication, rural and agricultural development. It high-lights principles of communication, types of communication, communication barriers and the role of communication in a holistic and sustainable rural and agricultural development in Benue State, Nigeria. The epilogue concludes by noting that as long as there is continued imbalance in the diffusion of agricultural information and wrongful targeting of information, the possibility of harnessing the full potentials of our rural populace towards attaining sustainable and holistic national, rural and agricultural development will remain problematic and in a limbo and another political snafu. It is recommended that segmentation of the target audience based on needs, interested agro-ecological areas should be adopted by senders of agricultural messages; and decentralization of radio, and television broadcasting in local languages should be encouraged and underscored.</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">The objective of the study was to map sweet potato value chain linkages between actors, processes and activities in Tanzania. The study is cross sectional in design.The study was conducted in Shinyanga rural and Mwanza urban districts. The study used individual interviews, focused group discussions; review of relevant practical documents and discussions with key informants. A total of 150 actors in the value chain participated. Data collected was summarized using Statistical Package of Social Science (SPSS) and content analysis. Analysis of data shows that “&lt;em&gt;Michembe” &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Matobolwa”&lt;/em&gt; were two main local made value added products derived from sweet potatoes preferred by producers. In general sweet potatoes production is marked with low production and productivity. Low productivity is a result of poor agronomic practices and low level of production technology application among others. Three main marketing channels exist in the study area: Producers selling directly to consumer; producers to retailers to consumer; and producers to hawkers/village vendors to consumer. Moreover data revealed that (50.7%) of sampled producers set prices after hearing from their fellow farmers. About (44%) of the sampled producers sell their produce direct to the market. The sub sector in general faces a number of structural and technological problems that need immediate attention to revamp agricultural sector development.</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;A total of one hundred (100) day old broilers of mixed sexes were used to investigate the effects of graded levels of distillers dried grain on performance, nutrient utilization, and carcass evaluation. The birds were randomly allocated to five treatment groups of 20birds, and were further replicated five times. The five treatments comprised of graded levels of Distiller Dried Grain (DDG) in 0, 10, 20, 30 40% inclusion to replace maize.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Feed intake, weight gain and feed/gain ratio were significantly affected (P&amp;lt;0.05) by levels of DDG. Average daily feed intake increased with increasing levels of DDG. Birds fed 40% DDG had the highest (72.90g/bird/day) feed intake while the birds on the control diet had the lowest (68.04g/bird/day) feed intake. Weight gain was significantly affected (P&amp;lt;0.05) by dietary DDG. Birds fed 10% DDG had the highest weight gain (27.95g/bird/day). Beyond this dietary inclusion level (10%), weight gain continued to decrease. Birds fed 40% DDG had the lowest weight gain (23.10g/bird/day). Nutrient retention was significantly affected (P&amp;lt;0.05) by dietary DDG. Protein and fat retention decreased with increase in level of dietary DDG. These nutrients were retained more by broilers fed 10% dietary level of DDG. Dietary levels of DDG had no significant influence (P&amp;lt;0.05) on the relative weight of the different body parts. It was concluded that up to 10% DDG can be used in broiler starter and finisher diet.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;This paper describes the economic and social challenges faced by Enfield, a small town in rural northeastern North Carolina, and the efforts by the Center for Competitive Economies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to assist the community in a strategic economic development plan to address these challenges. In particular, the paper outlines the challenges and tensions between place-based versus people-based economic development approaches and how these tensions are generalizeable to other rural small towns. Lastly, the paper concludes that even the most effective economic development strategies may only impact the community marginally given the larger confluence of events in the broader region, such as general population loss due to outmigration, declining traditional industries, and stagnant regional economies.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;The organic market is growing at a steady pace of 20 percent annually; this farming method can bring several advantages to the consumers and also to the farmers. Among other things organic farming does not have to rely on access to external inputs such as fertilizer and pesticides because the farmers make use of their own resources. This not only represents a friendlier environment to the farmer or the land but also can be cheaper. The aim of this study is to find out the yield differential between three productions systems (organic, biofertilized and conventional) of guava crops in Zitacuaro, Michoacan, Mexico.&lt;/p&gt; The results indicated that the most profitable crop in terms of production costs and profits on Zitacuaro´s region is the biofertilized crop that takes up the sustainable practices combined with conventional practices in a lesser proportion. While organic and conventional crops shows a slide difference between them.</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">Nanofiber membranes for chiral separation were prepared from chitin, which is the most abundant natural amino polysaccharide. The membrane showed chiral separation ability by adopting concentration gradient as a driving force for membrane transport. In other words, the chitin nanofiber membrane selectively transported the D-isomer of glutamic acid (Glu), phenylalanine (Phe), and lysine (Lys) from the corresponding racemic amino acid mixtures.</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">Compared to other groups of organisms, plants require distinctive approaches in their conservation because of their keystone roles in ecosystems and economies. The state of the whole plant cover of the Earth should be of concern to conservationists – for its capacity to ensure the survival of plant species, deliver ecosystem services (locally to globally) and provide produce from plants in ecologically sustainable ways. The primary targets of attention in ecosystem-based plant conservation are the relationships between people and plants, as relevant to every locality, rather than the species-centric approach of conventional plant conservation. Moving plant conservation to an ecosystem-based approach will require the development of training programmes for field practitioners and of information systems for their use.</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">Field experiments were carried out during the rainy seasons of 2008 and 2009 at the teaching and research farm of Nasarawa State University, Keffi, Lafia campus in the southern Guinea savanna agro-ecological zone of Nigeria to assess the effects of poultry manure, cow manure and sheep manure on the performance of sesame crop. Manure application was found to have significantly increased both yield and yield attributes of sesame compared with non application at all. Application of 2.5 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of poultry manure produced the highest value for all the yield attributes measured. The seed yield per hectare in both years were also optimized with the application of 2.5 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of poultry manure (1914.07 and 1933.20 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2008 and 2009 respectively) compared with any other applied rates of sheep and cow manure and is therefore recommended.</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Million liters of annual toxic solutions are used to combat pests and plant diseases and weeds in farms. Drift is one of the most critical problems which chemical applicators have to deal with. Wind drift would be highly controlled if the droplet size could be kept almost constant in stable atmospheric conditions.The most important factor in spraying is droplet size which is influenced by several factors including; spraying pressure, nozzle orifice diameter, the chemical viscosity and wind speed in the region. In this study factors affecting particle size have been studied using statistical methods. Nozzle orifice diameter and spraying pressure were considered as independent variables and particle size was chosen as the dependent variable. Analysis of variance showed that the effect of pressure and nozzle diameter and their interactive effect on particle volume mean diameter (VMD) were statistically significant at the 1% level. In order to compare the results estimated from regression equations and observed particle diameter chi-square test was used. Based on this test, the difference was not significant.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Adoption of conservation agriculture (CA) is quite low in most parts of Africa. However, Zambia has been quite successful in increasing adoption of CA among smallholder farmers. Few studies using both quantitative and qualitative approaches have been conducted in Zambia to determine factors influencing adoption of CA. This study uses mixed methods approach to document factors influencing adoption of CA among smallholder farmers under the Conservation Agriculture Project (CAP) in Zambia. From a random sample of 415 smallholder farmers, results showed that 71% had adopted CA. Quantitative analysis indicated that CA trainings, previous experience in minimum tillage, membership in farmer organisations, and ownership of CA tillage equipment significantly increased the likelihood of CA adoption. Number of CA trainings attended, farm size, number of rippers owned and use of herbicide had a significant positive influence on area under CA. Qualitative approaches showed that good rapport with farmers, trust, reciprocity and altruism, monitoring and evaluations, extension strategy, quality and extent of technical knowledge in CA within CFU, and artificial incentives positively influenced adoption of CA. Traditional leadership was reported to enhance adoption of CA in most cases. Prestige was reported to withhold some men from adopting CA basins. Women were very involved in CA basins while men were mostly involved in ADP ripping. Some worldviews of farmers had negative influence on adoption of CA. Donor support and collaboration with the Zambia National Farmers Union and private sector were other contextual factors for the high adoption of CA among sampled smallholder farmers. In the promotion of CA it is important to pay attention to both quantitative and qualitative factors influencing adoption. A mixed methods approach thus can lead to a better understanding of the adoption of CA than a single research strategy approach.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;This paper uses the farmer household’s model to structure the analytical framework of concurrent business cultivated land use behavior and its efficiency and then uses group comparison analysis and data envelopment analysis (DEA) to analyze the diversity of cultivated land use behavior and efficiency, among different types of concurrent business farmer which is based on the promise of separation not established and investigation data of farmer household. The results demonstrate that the concurrent business types have a significant influence on utilization patterns and farmer household’s behavioral options, different types of farmers’ investment, management and land scale have a big difference. Generally speaking, capital and labor input of concurrent business farmer household are high than that of specialized farmer, concurrent business farmer household Class ? are higher than that of Class ?; and different utilization patterns lead to the difference of cultivated land use efficiency. Moreover, technical efficiency of specialized farmer household is higher than that of concurrent business farmer household Class ? based on the separation was not established, and both of them are higher than that of concurrent business farmer household Class ?. That illustrates land use efficiency of farmer household will reduce as the level of concurrent business increase.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;This study focused on the physicochemical characterization of the kernels from &lt;em&gt;Terminalia catappa&lt;/em&gt; L. and sensory evaluation of appetizers concocted from these kernels. The results of the physicochemical analyzes were as follow: ash (4.0±0.1%), proteins (40.9±1.3%), lipids (50.6±1.0%), total sugars (1.4±0.1%), reducing sugars (0.3±0.01%) and moisture content (3.8±0.4%). Acid and peroxide values were respectively 1.3±0.2% and 6.30±0.23 meq O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/kg oil. Two appetizers were concocted from the fresh kernels of &lt;em&gt;Terminalia catappa&lt;/em&gt; L: Salted Roasted Kernels (SRK) and Unsalted Roasted Kernels (URK). A comparison of sensory profiles of both appetizers showed that they were not significantly different (p&amp;lt;5%) for the parameters sweet and oily but different (p&amp;lt;5%) for the parameters salty, bitter and firm. However, the tasters’ preference for the Salted Roasted Kernels was not significantly different from their preference for the Unsalted Roasted Kernels. The appetizers from &lt;em&gt;Terminalia catappa&lt;/em&gt; L. (SRK and URK) were then compared to other appetizers readily available in markets and malls: Salted Roasted Peanuts (SRP), Unsalted Roasted Peanuts (URP), Unsalted Roasted Hazelnuts (URH) and Salted Roasted Cashew nuts (SRC). The preference order was: URH&amp;lt;URK&amp;lt;SRK&amp;lt;URP&amp;lt;SRC&amp;lt;SRP.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

Birds fed Alphamune at 0.04 and 0.05% had the best feed to gain ratio. Broiler chicks fed 0.04% of Alphamune G had the highest fibre, fat and ash retention (68.70, 77.46, and 59.88%, respectively). There was no significant difference (P&amp;gt;0.05) in the carcass characteristics of birds fed different graded levels of Alphamune G. Haematological parameters show no significant difference among levels of Alphamune G. Serum biochemical values did not show any significant effect except for cholesterol, creatinine and uric acid. Alphamune G at 0.04% inclusion in diets may help improve performance of broiler chicken.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;The main tactics of soybean integrated pest management combine plant resistance and biological control. The impact of insect resistant IAC-24 soybean cultivar [caterpillars of &lt;em&gt;Anticarsia gemmatalis&lt;/em&gt; Hübner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in UFVS-2006 soybean cultivar susceptible to insects and water compared to &lt;em&gt;A. gemmatalis&lt;/em&gt; in IAC-24 soybean cultivar resistant to insects and water] on the nymphal and adult stages of the predator &lt;em&gt;Podisus nigrispinus&lt;/em&gt; Dallas (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) was evaluated. The duration and survival of the instars and nymphal stage and the body mass of nymphs, males and females of this predator were similar between treatments. The periods of pre-oviposition, oviposition, post-oviposition and egg incubation; interval between egg clutch; number of egg clutch per female, eggs per egg clutch, eggs per female, nymphs per female, nymphs per egg clutch and percentage of nymph eclosion and male and female longevity were also similar between treatments. The use of insect resistant IAC-24 soybean cultivar on &lt;em&gt;P. nigrispinus&lt;/em&gt; was found to be safe because that legume did not have any deleterious effects on the referred predator.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;This study was carried out to evaluate the physicochemical properties and rheological behavior of a number of tomato pastes imported by Nigeria food marketers. Chemical composition, color measurement, consistency, viscometry and flow index were determined. There were significant differences among the samples and some of the parameters did not meet the standard requirements set by food drug and administration of (FDA). The viscometry consistency test and flow index at 30&lt;sup&gt; o&lt;/sup&gt;C, 45&lt;sup&gt; o&lt;/sup&gt;C and 60&lt;sup&gt; o&lt;/sup&gt;C indicated the existence of variations among the samples in terms of viscosity and flow index increase as temperature increases. All tomato paste samples in the study were non-Newtonian fluids and the apparent viscosity of the paste decreased with temperature increase. The rheological data obtained were fitted using power law equation. The differences obtained were attributed to raw materials variation and processing conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">In order to be meaningful, agricultural research has to provide solutions to problems, especially in the international agricultural research system which is designed to contribute to enhanced food production and improved rural livelihoods in the lesser-developed world. Training and human resource development, whether at the technical support or research scientists/managerial level, is fundamental to an effective agricultural research and technology transfer system. By comparison with the developed world, the national agricultural research systems (NARS) in developing countries are weak, often with ineffective extension programs, as typified by the West Asia-North Africa (WANA) region, which is served by the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA). Despite the potential benefits of enhancing human skills, training and human resource development activities are often under-valued and under-funded in international research centers that serve developing countries. By highlighting training at ICARDA and its mandate countries, we sought to give renewed focus on this important component of the mission of the Consultative Group on Agricultural Research (CGIAR). In this article, we considered ICARDA’s philosophy and concepts on training, collaborating institutions, educational materials, categories of training, development of training courses, significant outcomes of training, shifting paradigms, and future directions. ICARDA’s innovative collaborative approach is a model to be emulated not only by the Centers but by other international institutions involved in agricultural and rural development in the developing countries. At this crucial time of restructuring of the CGIAR, renewed emphasis on training has never been more urgent.</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;This study reports on the land degradation minimizing effects of Conservation Agriculture (CA) as promoted among smallholder Zambian farmers. It found no evidence of CA associated improvements in soil fertility after five years of CA practice, most probably because crop residues were removed from the fields. The study reports high phosphorus (15.53 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) and potassium (0.75 cmol kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) levels, low nitrogen (0.12 %) and organic carbon (1.19 %) levels, and no plough/hoe pans in soils from both CA and conventionally (CV) managed fields. This is in part contrary to the dominant land degradation narratives which have been the basis for promoting CA in the study areas. &lt;em&gt;Faidherbia albida&lt;/em&gt;, a leguminous tree promoted as part of the CA package in Zambia, is associated with significantly higher levels of nitrogen, organic carbon and potassium under its canopy. Its planting by CA farmers is linked to the incentives provided by CA promoters. Average maize yields of 3.8 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and 2.8 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1 &lt;/sup&gt;were reported under CA and CV systems respectively. Government subsidies for mineral fertilizer and hybrid seed promote maize mono-cropping and remain unsupportive of CA. It is concluded that the dominant land degradation narrative, which posits population induced land degradation, may not hold in this case. Instead, the removal of crop residues and low levels of mineral fertilizer and manure amendments may better explain the soil fertility status of the study areas. More nutrient replacement strategies are required if the benefits of CA on soil fertility are to be actualized in the immediate future.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Adequately equipped field stations are essential for any institution involved with applied agricultural research. The field station is particularly crucial to the functioning of the network of global international research centers. The International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas addresses issues mainly related to dryland cropping system of the West Asia and North Africa region. It extends its effectiveness in northern Syria through a range of sub-stations and on-farm sites across the rainfall transect (150-600 mm). This article describes the environment and management of the Center that backstops its applied and adaptive research. Particular strengths of the station are highlighted. Unique features of the station that further the technology generation and transfer are described. While some aspects of international research station management are generic, there are considerations described that are specific to an evolving dryland research center in a rapidly changing region.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;The availability and scarcity of both surface and ground water alongwith adverse impacts of contaminated water have become major problems in Pakistan. Groundwater arsenic contamination in the southern part of the country has exponentially endangered the human life and complicated the efforts to provide safe drinking water in the arsenic contaminated areas. To gauge the adverse impacts amongst the affected population, household survey in Basti Rasul Pur district Rahim Yar Khan was conducted on core socio-economic indicators such as household conditions, sex ratio, earning sources, literacy, health morbidity, water borne diseases, drinking water contamination, education, employment and unemployment, expenditure on hospitalization for drawing best possible conclusions. Resultantly, sex ratio observed was about 1.01% for adults and 9.8 % for children. A total of 77 % water samples were found with arsenic contamination, due to which 50 % people were found with arsencosis symptoms and 60% of their earnings were being spent on hospitalization. Due to poverty and illiteracy, the entire population was un-aware of the adverse impacts of drinking water arsenic contamination. There is a dire need of installation of sustainable community based arsenic mitigation technologies for provisioning of safe drinking water to affected community.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Land consolidation is a strategy for the development of Iranian rice-growing regions. The most important targets of the program are reducing rice farmers' expenses and increasing their income. The object of this article is to conduct a factor analysis of Iranian paddy-field consolidation. The research was conducted in the form of a survey study. The data was collected from188 farmers participating in a farm-development program in Guilan province, sampled using a stratified random sampling method. The reliability of the questionnaire was calculated using a Cronbach alpha coefficient (alpha &amp;gt;0.78) for different sections after conducting a pilot study. Factor analysis for farmers with rice fields in projects showed that five factors explained 63.92% of total variance. These factors were: 1) social, 2) instructional, 3) environmental, 4) economic and 5) institutional effects. Social effects alone, the factor with the greatest effect, explained 34.84% of total variance.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Vermicompost may be a promising substitute for peat especially in transplant production. Vermicomposting is a sustainable solution for management of organic wastes. However, due to variability of organic wastes, vermicomposts might have varying nutrient content levels. The study compared vermicomposts from different sources on growth and nutrition of tomato (&lt;em&gt;Solanum lycopersicum&lt;/em&gt; L.) transplants. Chemical composition of vermicomposts differed. Common characteristics were high pH and very high electrical conductivity. All vermicomposts stimulated growth of tomato transplants, with up to a 2.2-fold increase occurring in shoot biomass. Differences in growth were attributed mainly to differences in nutrient content of the potting mixtures, but some changes in physical and biological properties of the substrate could also be responsible.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

line-height: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt;" lang="EN-US"&gt;Changes in agricultural land use as a consequence of an increased demand of energy crops have resulted in an increase of maize cropped area in many regions of Germany. The focus on maize as main biogas substrate, has led in some cases to negative ecological and environmental impacts, such as a loss of agro biodiversity reflected in a loss of field flora and fauna biodiversity. The present paper deals with the evaluation of the fauna in different bioenergy cropping systems on two sites in South-West Germany, with a special focus on the species richness of carabid beetle (&lt;em&gt;Coleoptera: Carabidae&lt;/em&gt;) assemblages as an indicator for the general status of diversity. A maize field, an agroforestry system with maize and different tree species as well as different alternative biogas crops (amaranth, sunflower) was investigated for their carabid beetle activity, density, and species richness using pitfall traps. Moreover, for an adequate evaluation of the carabid assemblages different common diversity indices (Shannon-Wiener diversity (&lt;em&gt;H’&lt;/em&gt;), Simpson diversity (&lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt;) and Evenness (&lt;em&gt;J’&lt;/em&gt;)) were used. In the case of the maize field on both field edges 8 and 6 carabid beetle species, respectively were trapped, while in the field centre 2 carabid beetle species were trapped. The agroforestry system indicated slightly higher crabid beetle species richness close to the tree strips. The investigation of alternative biogas crops showed no significant differences in carabid beetle diversity. Overall, the results of the different studies showed, that biodiversity of bioenergy cropping systems could be enhanced by the creation of refuge areas for carabid beetles or other animals. Refuges could be either field margins with grass and hedgerows or strips of more extensively used perennial energy crops across the field. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Motivated by the recent global economic crisis, this paper simulated the impact of a rise in the price of imported food on agriculture and household poverty in Nigeria using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model and the Foster, Greer and Thorbecke (FGT) class of decomposable poverty measures on the 2006 social accounting matrix (SAM) of Nigeria and the updated 2004 Nigeria Living Standards Survey (NLSS) data. Results show that a rise in import price of food increased domestic output of food, but reduced the domestic supply of other agricultural commodities as well as food and other agricultural composites. Furthermore, a rise in the import price of food increased poverty nationally and among all household groups, with rural-north households being the least affected by the shock, while their rural-south counterparts were the most affected. A major policy implication drawn from this paper is that high import prices in import competing sectors like agriculture tend to favour the sector but exacerbate poverty in households. Thus, efforts geared at addressing the impact of this shock should strive to balance welfare and efficiency issues.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p class="StandardTextkrperSAR"&gt;Water samples were collected from three sites (Ogbakiri, Choba and Iwofe) of the New Calabar River and were evaluated for microbiological and physico-chemical characteristics. Bacterial isolates consisting mainly of gram-negative bacteria (&lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter&lt;/em&gt; spp, &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella&lt;/em&gt; spp., &lt;em&gt;Vibrio&lt;/em&gt; sp. and &lt;em&gt;Nocardia asteroides&lt;/em&gt;) were isolated from the samples. The highest total coliform counts log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; 2.9 were encountered in water samples from Iwofe but the lowest counts log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;1.9 occurred in the water samples from Ogbakiri. Ecological parameters varied among the sites with the highest pH value of 7.87 occurring at Iwofe and lowest of 6.12 at Choba. Maximum salinity level of 15&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;00&lt;/sub&gt; was observed at Iwofe and lowest at Choba. In contrast, maximum dissolved oxygen of 10.1ppm was observed at Choba and the minimum at Iwofe. The different bacterial profiles are probably attributable to the anthropogenic and industrial activities of the sites.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Field boundaries with permanent vegetation cover are a key habitat for farmland biodiversity. Buffer zones are wide field boundaries established to prevent nutrient leaching and erosion into waterways and serve as habitats for farmland wildlife. Our main hypothesis was that several years of grazing or cutting management results in greater plant species richness and heterogeneity in buffer zones in comparison with sites managed for only a few years. We also hypothesized that litter cover and soil phosphorus (P) level would decrease after several years of management, in comparison sites with relatively few years of management. Through this study we aimed to gain a better understanding of how to increase biodiversity in buffer zones. The study included 15 buffer zones within a single landscape. Mean species richness was significantly higher in the group of sites grazed over several years (21 species) in contrast to extensively cut sites (14.8 species) and/or grazed sites (18 species). Species heterogeneity did not respond to different management regimes. Management, slope aspect and litter were significant explanatory factors for species composition. The amount of soil phosphorus measured at three different depths was significantly lower in the buffer zones managed by cutting or grazing for a few years in contrast to those that were grazed for several years. Management that positively affected species diversity did not result in the expected decrease in soil phosphorus. Therefore, we propose that the greater species richness at grazed sites results mainly from disturbances caused by grazing.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;This study aims to investigate the evolution, throughout the harvest season, of merchantability criteria and Ochratoxin A (OTA) levels in cocoa beans produced in Cote d'Ivoire. To this end, 567 samples of cocoa beans, collected in 6 production areas during the 2007-2008 season, were analyzed. Merchantability and OTA levels were determined respectively according to the Ivorian Coffee and Cocoa stock exchange standards and the European Community regulation related to the analytical methods for the control of mycotoxins levels in foodstuffs (EC 401/2006). Concerning merchantability, a significant difference at 5% risk was revealed between the values of moisture, graining and grades. As regards OTA levels, the concentrations obtained ranged from 0.41 µg/kg to 1.36 µg/kg of cocoa beans with an average concentration of 0.69 µg/kg. These concentrations are all below the maximum value set at 2 µg/kg by the European Commission. Moldy and/or slaty beans are chiefly answerable for the depreciation of cocoa beans marketability. These results served to devise a map summarizing the quality of Ivorian cocoa beans. Needless to say, this map is just a representation of a situation at a given time, and should therefore contribute to take up decisions relevant to the application of good production and postharvest processing practices in the country’s quest for cocoa beans of prime quality.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p class="StandardTextkrperSAR"&gt;Nigeria loses about $750 million annually to the depletion of its 350 000 hectares of land by direct human activities and climate change. Consequently, the Sahara Desert has been moving southwards by 600 metres annually. 10 000 farming families have already been forced to move off the degraded land that has become barren. In the light of this, this study examined climate mitigation activities and determinants in Nigeria. Specifically, the study examined climate change knowledge/perception, cost implications and mitigation practices of rural households as well as factors responsible for the level of mitigation activities. 120 household respondents were selected across 8 communities in the Guinea Savannah of Kwara State, Nigeria. Study analytical tools used were descriptive statistics, principal component and Tobit analysis. Results showed that households perceived the effects of increased temperatures, reduced rainfall, desertification, flooding and increased crop pest and disease infestations. Crop harvest losses due to changing climate were large and worrisome. Principal component analysis PCA results implied that prevalent practices undertaken to combat climate change were crude and non-radical. These activities were inorganic and organic fertilizers use, mulching, bush fallow and crude agro-forestry practices. Factors determining the extent of mitigation activities were found to include educational status, type of farming activities and farm size. The study therefore calls for radical efforts at educating the rural masses on climate change devastations and the need for mitigating climate change, use of early maturing crop varieties. Green zone/forest should be developed while tree planting and afforestation should be encouraged and possibly enforced.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;This paper assesses the origins of and changes to fertilizer policy in Nepal over a period of time. It assesses farmers’ awareness of the recent changes to the subsidy policy and examines their perceptions of the extension services. This paper looks at the environmental implications of the concentrated application of chemical fertilizer, particularly as far as food security is concerned. Questionnaire surveys, group discussions, a workshop, soil analyses and archival materials were used to collect data for this study. Changes in fertilizer policy have occurred in four different phases: (i) without subsidy; (ii) with subsidy; (iii) with deregulation of fertilizer trade; and (iv) the current phase of subsidies for fertilizer. However, timely and effective fertilizer distribution by the government has always been a problem. Only few farmers (12 %) know about recent changes in the fertilizer policy; most of them (44 %) were satisfied with the new subsidy scheme. Valid proof of land ownership is a requirement for qualifying for subsidized fertilizer, and this makes it difficult for some small farmers who are tenant. The soil analysis indicated a significant decrease in the soil pH as a result of intensified agriculture. One reason is due to the intensive use of chemical fertilizers and the declining use of farmyard manure. The ineffectiveness of the extension services also influences farmers’ use of fertilizer as they are not aware of which fertilizer and how much to use. The use of fertilizer may increase yields in the short term, but in the longer term, it may worsen the food insecurity in the country.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Changes in exchange rate and international prices greatly affect food availability, the agricultural sector, and Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This study quantifies the effects of change in exchange rate and world prices on Sudan’s agricultural production, imports, exports, and GDP. Special emphasis has been placed on sorghum and wheat, the main food grains. A Standard Computable General Equilibrium model has been developed and used for the analysis. The main objective is to contribute to policy-making process for enhancing food security and social welfare in the Sudan&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Currency depreciation would reduce wheat imports and increase its domestic production, increase sorghum export, increase domestic output and export of sesame and cotton, and improves GDP; and vice versa for appreciation. Appreciation favors urban (wheat) consumers, whereas depreciation favors rural (sorghum) consumers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Increasing world price of wheat would decrease its imports, whereas that of sorghum would encourage its production and export, and increase domestic food prices. GDP decreases due to investment reduction&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is recommended that wheat import should be conditioned on hard currency availability and food gap, while maintaining stable exchange rate that strike a balance between encouraging sorghum exports and wheat imports. It is also recommended to encourage innovation of fast food from traditional grains to curb the shift to wheat consumption.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;The effect of different concentrations of garlic (&lt;em&gt;Allium sativum&lt;/em&gt;) supplement in fish diet on growth and haematological parameters of &lt;em&gt;Clarias gariepinus&lt;/em&gt; fingerlings was investigated. Fish were separated into four experimental groups of 0% (controls), 0.5%, 1.0% and 3% concentrations of garlic in diet and fed at 3% body weight per day in a renewal static bioassay system. Garlic supplemented diet did not have any significant effect on weight gain of &lt;em&gt;C. gariepinus&lt;/em&gt; when compared to fish in the control diet. However, final fish weight was significantly (P&amp;lt;0.05) higher than the initial fish weight in all concentrations of garlic in fish diet and in the controls. No significant (P&amp;gt;0.05) difference in total length was observed in fish fed different concentrations of garlic at the end of 12 weeks. An increase in total length was observed in fish with garlic supplemented diet over fish in the control diet. Fish fed different concentrations of garlic in diet showed slight differences in total length but did not significantly (P&amp;gt;0.05) differ from each other in total length. Fish in 0.5% garlic diet had higher weight gain and total length than fish in the rest of the treatment groups and the controls. Final white blood cell (WBC), red blood cell (RBC), packed cell volume (PCV), haemoglobin (Hb) were observed to be significantly (P&amp;lt;0.05%) higher than the initial counts in the treatment groups as compared to the controls. RBC, PCV and Hb were however, significantly higher in fish fed 0.5% garlic supplemented diets than other concentrations. Plasma protein was observed to increase significantly (P&amp;lt;0.05) only in fish fed 0.5% and 1.0% garlic in diet. This study has shown that 0.5% (0.5g/kg) garlic supplement in fish feeds elicited more increase in fish total length and volume of haematological parameters of &lt;em&gt;C.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;gariepinus.&lt;/em&gt; Garlic inclusion in fish diet at 0.5% (0.5g/kg) concentration is&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;therefore beneficial for use in aquaculture to enhance the disease resistant status of &lt;em&gt;C. gariepinus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;The search for environmentally biocompatible and cost-effective methods to control filamentous fungi in agriculture is becoming increasingly urgent. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; antimicrobial activity of three synthetic peptides was investigated against some filamentous fungi with agricultural relevance. The peptides were an analog of Temporin called Temporizina, a fragment from Pleurocidin termed Plc-2, and a peptide identified from sesame seeds named Pses3. Antimicrobial activity of these peptides towards filamentous fungi has not been previously reported. Seven plant pathogenic or mycotoxigenic fungal species, isolated from plant tissues were assayed: &lt;em&gt;Alternaria&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;solani&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Colletotrichum&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;gloesporioides&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fulvia &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;fulvum&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fusarium oxisporum&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Aspergillus niger&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;A. ochraceus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Penicillium digitatum&lt;/em&gt;. Values of Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Fungicidal Concentration (MFC) were determined and compared with the commercially available fungicide Captan as a positive control. The peptides showing greatest inhibition were Pses3 and Plc-2 and &lt;em&gt;C. gloesporioides &lt;/em&gt;was the most sensitive of the evaluated fungi. The MIC&lt;sub&gt; &lt;/sub&gt;values for Plc-2 and Pses3 peptides ranged from 0.64 µM to 10.25 µM. These values were much lower than those observed for Captan, suggesting the potential of these peptides as fungicides. In particular, Pses3 is a novel peptide derived from sesame seeds not reported in databases.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

The study was conducted between January and April 2008. Extracts of the two plants were sprayed on cabbage plants to control these pests. A standard synthetic chemical insecticide (Mektin) was used as reference product. The experiment was conducted in a randomized complete block design and each treatment was replicated four times. The effects of plant extracts on the population dynamics of the pests’ species, the level of infestation and yield were assessed. Significantly more of the pests infested the control plants than the treated plants (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt; 0.01). The mean weight of cabbage heads on the sprayed plots was significantly heavier than that of the control unsprayed plots. The use of &lt;em&gt;A. indica&lt;/em&gt; seeds and &lt;em&gt;L. camara&lt;/em&gt; leaf extracts increased yield by 37.05% and 25.80%, respectively. Spraying the cabbage plants with the plant extracts significantly reduced the numbers of pests compared with the control plants. The use of these plant extracts can be incorporated into an overall control programme of these pests.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;The quality of a soil is often viewed in relation to its ability to suppress plant disease and enhance agricultural productivity. A soil is considered suppressive when, in spite of favourable conditions for disease incidence and development, a pathogen cannot become established, or establishes but produces no disease, or establishes and produces disease for a short time and then declines. The interplay of biotic and abiotic factors has long been known to assert disease suppressive capabilities or otherwise. However, the multi-functionality of soil makes the identification of a single property as a general indicator of soil health an uphill task. In this paper, therefore, some indicators of soil health important to agriculture are reviewed with emphasis on pea footrot disease suppression potentials. Findings show that footrot disease due to &lt;em&gt;Nectria haematococca &lt;/em&gt;(anamorph &lt;em&gt;Fusarium solani &lt;/em&gt;f.sp &lt;em&gt;pisi&lt;/em&gt;) is a globally, economically important disease of peas, and an initial inoculum density of ? 100 pathogenic forms of &lt;em&gt;N. haematococca &lt;/em&gt;cells would produce an appreciable level of pea footrot disease depending on the relative amount of phosphorus, carbon and nitrogen present in soil. It would be desirable to confirm pea footrot disease models obtained from pot experiments with results from field experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

In this study, &lt;em&gt;Balanites aegyptiaca&lt;/em&gt; seeds were subjected to ethanol extraction, to examine the effect on the nutrient, phytochemical, organoleptic as well as textural properties of the seed kernel. The result showed a significant (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.05) decrease in lipid content from 37.11% to 9.98% and a significant (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.05) increase in protein content from 31.73% to 37.68%. There was a reduction in the level of tannin from 0.0690 to 0.0043 mg/100g, phytic acid 108.65 to 36.65 mg/100g and oxalate 30.01 to 15.03 mg/100g. The results show that ethanol extraction is an effective processing technique for enhancing the suitability of &lt;em&gt;Balanites aegyptiaca&lt;/em&gt; seed kernel as an alternative protein source in animal feeding.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Growing soybean (&lt;em&gt;Glycine max L.)&lt;/em&gt; prior to corn (&lt;em&gt;Zea mays&lt;/em&gt; L) can enhance corn grain and nitrogen (N) use efficiency compared to continuous corn. This two year study (2007-2008) was conducted at 62 sites in Quebec (Eastern Canada) to assess the effect of crop rotations [soybean-corn, soybean-wheat (&lt;em&gt;Triticum aestivum&lt;/em&gt; L.,)-corn and corn-corn] on corn yield, N uptake, N fertilizer efficiency (NFE), and the economic optimum N rate (EONR). Plots within each crop rotation received N fertilizer rates from 0 to 250 kg N ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; to assess the N contribution from the preceding soybean crop. Corn grain yields ranged from 8.4 to 10.8 Mg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and were lower in continuous corn than in the crop rotations. Corn N uptake and NFE varied from 89 to 164 kg N ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and from 45 to 80 kg grain per kg N fertilizer, respectively. A significant interaction of crop rotation and year on corn N uptake and NFE was obtained implying that annual variations influenced soil N supply. The EONR for corn was lower under crop rotations than continuous corn in 2008 only. No difference in corn yield, NFE and EONR was observed for soybean-corn and soybean-wheat-corn crop sequences. In conclusion, crop rotations including soybean increased soil N availability and reduced EONR from 32 to 45  kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for corn grown in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Studies were conducted to test the effectiveness of native soap against cowpea insect pests during the late cowpea cropping season in two agro-ecological zones-Asaba and Abraka, Delta State. Four major insect pests, namely the cowpea aphid, &lt;em&gt;Aphis craccivora&lt;/em&gt; Koch, the legume flower bud thrips, &lt;em&gt;Megalurothrips sjostedti &lt;/em&gt;Tryb, the legume pod borer, &lt;em&gt;Maruca vitrata &lt;/em&gt;Fab and pod sucking bugs were studied. The experiment was made up of five treatments-1, 2 and 3 percent concentrations of native soap, cypermethrin (as conventional chemical and check) and a control. Each treatment was replicated three times. The experiment was arranged into a randomised complete block design (RCBD). The results showed that all the major insect pests occurred in the study areas but were more at Asaba compared to Abraka. Native soap was effective against &lt;em&gt;A. craccivora &lt;/em&gt;and flower bud thrips population at Asaba. &lt;em&gt;Maruca vitrata &lt;/em&gt;was not affected by soap application. Grain yield was high at Abraka and significantly (P&amp;lt;0.05) higher than Asaba. The use of native soap as non-conventional insecticide in cowpea insect pests management appears promising, more so as it is not expensive and safe to handle. Farmers may prefer it to synthetic chemical pesticides with their associated dangers.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;The South Kelantan Development Authority (KESEDAR) and the Federal Land Development Authority (FELDA) are the two main agencies that develop land schemes in the district of Gua Musang, Kelantan. The nine land schemes developed by FELDA are Kemahang 3, Chiku 1, Chiku 2, Chiku 3, Chiku 5, Chiku 6, Chiku 7, Perasu, and Aring 1. KESEDAR also developed eleven land schemes namely Paloh 1, Paloh 2, Paloh 3, Chalil, Lebir, Meranto, Sungai Terah, Renok Baru, Jeram Tekoh, Limau Kasturi, and Sungai Asap. A large part of the schemes under the FELDA was planted with oil palm (84.7%) while the rest was planted with rubber trees. On the other hand, most of the land schemes under KESEDAR were planted with rubber (67%), while the remainder were planted with oil palm. The question that arises is to what extent is the role of both the agencies in advancing the standard of living of the settlers? What are the problems faced by the settlers and their implications regarding their socio-economic level? This paper will discuss the role played by KESEDAR and FELDA in advancing the standard of living of the settlers as well as identifying the problems faced by the settlers under the two agencies. The study found that many settlers earned between RM600 - RM1200 per month despite the efforts undertaken by FELDA and KESEDAR to improve the living standards of the settlers. The main problems faced by the settlers are: palm oil prices are volatile; oil palm trees are old, the old age of the settlers, and the settlers’ chidren migrating to the city.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p class="StandardTextkrperSAR"&gt;The study identified the factors influencing the discontinuance of improved rice technologies in Nasarawa State of Central Nigeria. Multi-stage random sampling was purposely used to select eighty rice farmers from four rice-producing villages of the study area using structured interview schedule on the respondents. Statistical analysis involving frequency counts, means and percentage were used to satisfy objectives 1, 2, 3, and 4 while regression analysis was applied to satisfy objective 5. The results of the regression analysis showed that education and extension contact had significant but negative relationship at 5% level; while age had positive and significant relationship at 1% level with discontinuance of adoption of improved rice technologies. Farmers should be encouraged to participate in the on-going government rural literacy campaign while extension contact be enhanced to minimize discontinuance of improved rice technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;The watermelon and the green alfalfa are important crops in Morocco. The ripe fruit of the watermelon has a high nutritional value, rich in vitamin and mineral salts and used for medicinal purposes (kidneys and cleaning of the urinary tract). The alfalfa green is principally cultivated for livestock feed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A common problem in the production of watermelon and the alfalfa is the infestation by aphids. They transmit viruses of the tile to the plants. They are more likely to be a problem in the time costs. The study presents the effects of products Thyme, Oregano, Neem and their mixture on the aphids of watermelon in comparison with their effects on aphids of alfalfa green.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The tests were conducted of the months from May to September on the aphids on the fields of watermelon and alfalfa green. It determines the percentage of deaths of aphids in function of the dose 1% and 5% for these products and the time 3, 5 and 7 hours after treatment. A comparison between the results obtained showed that the extract of Thyme is more active in watermelon and the Oregano is in alfalfa.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p class="StandardTextkrperSAR"&gt;Farmers have always lived in changing environments where uncertainty and disturbances are inevitable. Therefore, farmers need the ability to adapt to change in order to be able to maintain their farms. Experimentation is one way for farmers to learn and adapt, and may be a tool to build farm resilience. Farmers’ experiments as defined in this paper are activities where something totally or partially new is introduced at the farm and the feasibility of this introduction is evaluated. The theoretical framework applied to study farmers’ experiments is the concept of resilience. Resilience is the capacity of social-ecological systems to cope with change, and is a framework used to assess complex systems of interactions between humans and ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="StandardTextkrperSAR"&gt;This paper explores to which extent farmers’ experimentation can help build farm resilience. In addition to arguments found in the literature, five organic farms in Eastern Austria are used to illustrate this potential. The farmers were interviewed in 2007 and 2008. The respective farmers all worked fulltime on their farms, were between 34 and 55 years old, and owned farms between 15 and 76 ha. These farmers experimented in ways that enhance resilience – at the farm and in the region. The outcome of experiments can be management changes, new insights, or technology that can be passed on and potentially be built into education and advisory institutions. To encourage farmers’ experiments, it is important to develop conditions that support farmers in their experimenting role.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p class="StandardTextkrperSAR"&gt;In the present study, some physical properties of the Iranian date (Berhi variety) were determined at three stages of maturity namely Khalal, Rotab and Tamar. Color and textural features of samples were extracted by image processing toolbox of Matlab software. Total soluble solids (TSS), pH and weight of samples were also measured. The relationship between color and TSS, surface area and weight were obtained. The maximum correlation between TSS content and color occurred in blue for Rotab and Tamar but in red for Khalal. In the meantime, color and textural features differences between three stages of maturity were significant. There was a linear relationship between weight and surface area.

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;This study is aimed at evaluating the efficiency of timber processors in Ondo State, Nigeria, using Data Envelopment Analysis. Multi stage sampling technique was used to select two Local Government Areas with the highest number of sawmills, from each of which twenty saw millers were randomly selected, given a total of forty saw millers. Based on Constant Return to Scale Technical Efficiency, 35% of the saw millers were technically efficient while on the basis of Variable Return to Scale TE, 60% of the saw millers were technically efficient. About 35% of the saw millers were scale efficient. The Data Envelopment Analysis output revealed that 35% of the sampled saw millers were both technically and scale efficient and were hence operating at the most productive scale size. About 65% of the saw millers were operating at sub-optimal condition. Excesses in input utilization were observed in respect of total fixed cost, costs of electricity, servicing of mill, timber from forest reserve and operation of truck; and remuneration of labour. The inefficient firms should be encouraged to emulate the operating practices of the most productive firms so as to improve their performance.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Smallholder sugarcane growing is central to rural development and poverty alleviation in Swaziland. The main objective of the study was to investigate the profitability of smallholder sugarcane farmers’ associations under KDDP and to explain the determinants of sugarcane profitability. The study used data from 2004/05 to 2010/11 production seasons for 15 smallholder sugarcane farmers’ associations under KDDP. A structured questionnaire was used to solicit production and financial data. Secondary data were obtained from accounting records of the farmers. The associations were purposively selected because of their experience in sugarcane production. Descriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values were used in data analysis. The cost and returns analysis was used to assess the profitability, whilst multiple linear regression analysis was used in identifying the determinants of profitability.The associations were found to be profitable with a mean profit per hectare of E5080.00.The further results indicated that variables such as farm size, farming experience, sucrose price, labour cost per hectare and fertilizer cost per hectare significantly (p&amp;lt;0.01) influence the profitability of smallholder sugarcane farmers’ associations in the study area. The adjusted R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; was 0.623, suggesting that about 62.3% in the variation in profit per hectare is explained by the explanatory variables. It is, therefore recommended that good crop husbandry practices like timely weeding, fertilization, and irrigation should be adopted to produce a good crop which will enhance profitability. There is need for the promotion of collective action as an institutional means to improve bargaining power of farmers, especially when procuring inputs. Collective action will enable smallholder sugarcane farmers to buy in bulk and be entitled to discounts and that can enhance sustainability of profitability of the farmers.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;A field experiment was conducted under irrigated conditions in the highlands of Madagascar to assess the potential of intercropping Italian ryegrass with common vetch for improving yield and quality of forage. Seed proportions studied were ryegrass-vetch 100:0; 0:100; 50:33; 50:50; 50:66; 75:33 and 75:66. Mixtures were sown in alternate rows and the sowing rates of pure stands of ryegrass and vetch were 20 and 60 kg per hectare, respectively. The results showed that all mixtures achieved yield advantage over pure stands with the highest land equivalent ratio value for dry matter yield obtained from the mixture of 75:66 (1.47) followed by 50:50 (1.35). Slight increase of crude protein content and protein digested in the small intestine when rumen-fermentable nitrogen is limiting (PDIN) content were obtained from mixtures compared with pure stand of ryegrass. Vetch rate in dry matter yield of mixtures increased with the increase of vetch seed proportion and ranged from 31 to 44%. Agressivity and competitive ratio indices showed that ryegrass was slightly competitive than vetch. Intercropping Italian ryegrass with common vetch at the seed proportions of 75:66 or 50:50 could be a more sustainable alternative cropping to alleviate dry season feed shortages of dairy livestock in the highlands of Madagascar.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rambuda irrigation scheme is situated in Vhembe District of Limpopo Province in South Africa. It was established in 1952 and farmers do not have access to recorded climatic information. Farmers are growing crops on a trial and error basis, hence low yields and crop loses. The objective of the study was to investigate indigenous knowledge of climatic conditions relevant for crop production using participatory techniques. Situation analysis was conducted to gain information on factors influencing crop choice. Participatory exercise was conducted with 33 of 104 of plot-holders. Farmers could identify climatic factors important for crop production and those limiting to crop performance. Hot, dry conditions during August to October and January months were limiting to crops, particularly sweet potato production. The results showed that indigenous knowledge of climate needs to be considered during agricultural development planning and scientists need to investigate linkages between modern agro-meteorology and indigenous knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">Food-security and sustainability is a serious global concern in the recent times. Many indigenous food crops of Africa which promises to ameliorate nutritional food insecurities are presently neglected and under-utilized. African yam bean (AYB) is one of such crop with tremendous nutritional potentials. The poor awareness about the taxonomy, agronomy, genetics, medicinal value and productive potential of the crop may be due to limited research on it. The subsistence production of the crop may have been occasioned by its poor acceptability as a valuable crop among middle-aged farmers in Africa. Research information on the crop is patchy in old and poorly accessible literature. There is an indisputable threat of irrecoverable loss of information on AYB especially in old archives. Some quality information on the crop was assembled from old books and proceedings, out-of print journals, pamphlets and recent publications. This review tried to congregate the bits and lumps of information on AYB research into a discrete summary which will create awareness about the future research needs on this crop.</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;The local lumbers, without restraints, are continually exploiting the Nigerian forests. This trend causes a massive reduction in the economic, recreational, water purification and other benefits derivable from the forest and forest products. The overall implication of this is that there is a shortfall in the market supply of wood and wood products in South Western Nigeria. This situation poses some challenges to the government, private operators and other stakeholders in timber industry. This study therefore, investigated the implications of the activities of the lumbers and the market equilibrium structure of wood industry in the region. Both the stochastic production frontier and market equilibrium analyses were done. Fuel, credit and trucks’ carrying capacities significantly determined the quantity of output of the lumbers. The estimates of the sigma square, d&lt;sup&gt;2 &lt;/sup&gt;(0.3811) and gamma, g, (0.9001) were positively significant at 1% level. The log likelihood function was large (24.6672) indicating a good fit. Estimated demand elasticity indicated that N1.00 increase in market price produced 14.14 %, 52.73% and 55.12% decrease in the quantities demanded for 2x3x12, 3x4x12 and 2x6x12 wood sizes. To further increase the output level of wood products in the region therefore, it is necessary to stabilize fuel prices and make the product available to the lumbers at the required time and quantities.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Irvingia &lt;/em&gt;(bush mango) species are economically important trees, but studies aimed at their prospect for domestication did not take into account the potential differences between members of the Genus. Hence fruit size, postharvest pathology and phytochemicals of &lt;em&gt;I. gabonensis &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;I. wombolu&lt;/em&gt; were studied. Results showed that whilst the mean weight, length, width and thickness of fruits of &lt;em&gt;I. gabonensis &lt;/em&gt;were 125.08g, 60.85mm, 62.66mm and 56.78mm, respectively, those obtained from &lt;em&gt;I. wombolu &lt;/em&gt;were 86.08g, 54.23mm, 54.09mm and 50.97mm, respectively. Difference in brownish-black rot fruit disease between the two &lt;em&gt;Irvingia&lt;/em&gt; species was not significant (&lt;em&gt;P=0.05&lt;/em&gt;), but disease severity increased correspondingly with increase in storage days. Four genera of fungi (&lt;em&gt;Aspergillus, Penicillium, Rhizopus &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Mucor&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;were isolated from fruits of both &lt;em&gt;Irvingia &lt;/em&gt;species, and &lt;em&gt;I. wombolu &lt;/em&gt;was found to sustain a significantly lower fungal population (7.76E+07 cfu) than &lt;em&gt;I. gabonensis &lt;/em&gt;(1.05E+08 cfu)&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;High fungal population led to a correspondingly high severity of brownish-black rot disease. Fruits of both&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Irvingia &lt;/em&gt;species&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;possessed all five phytochemicals (alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, tannins and glucosides). However, whilst both species had the same amounts of flavonoids and glycosides, &lt;em&gt;I. wombolu&lt;/em&gt; possessed relatively higher amounts of alkaloids, saponins and tannins than &lt;em&gt;I. gabonensis&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;I. wombolu &lt;/em&gt;may be the preferred choice if domestication would be based on phytochemicals. In like manner, &lt;em&gt;I. gabonensis &lt;/em&gt;may be the preferred choice for domestication if taste, weight and size of fruits were the parameters of interest.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Growth of the mudfish, &lt;em&gt;Clarias anguillaris&lt;/em&gt; in of treated and untreated domestic sewage was investigated. Six weeks old fingerlings obtained from Delta State  University, Asaba Campus Research Farm were used and the study lasted for 14 weeks. Fingerlings were kept in stock tank containing 10, 000 cm&lt;sup&gt;3 &lt;/sup&gt;bore hole water and allowed to acclimate for two weeks. The stock tank was well aerated and fingerlings fed twice daily at the rate of 4% body weight with poultry mash in a daily renewal static bioassay system. The stock (0%- control) was then diluted with bole hole water serially to give 25, 50, 75 % strength of the treated and untreated domestic sewage and 100 % into which 10 fingerlings each were introduced. Weekly measurement of growth parameters of fish total length and weight were taken. The condition factor (k) was calculated. Increase in fish total length and weight in control, treated and untreated domestic sewage was observed. Growth of fish was significantly higher (P&amp;lt;0.05) in the treated domestic sewage than in the untreated. There was no significant (P&amp;gt;0.05) difference in total length of fish in all concentrations of treated domestic sewage as compared with controls. However, fish in 100% concentration of domestic sewage had a slower increase in total length than fish in other treated concentrations. Weight gain in &lt;em&gt;C. anguillaris&lt;/em&gt; was higher in the 50% but not significantly (P&amp;gt;0.05) higher than other concentrations of treated domestic sewage. The increase in fish weight in the untreated domestic sewage was not significantly (P&amp;gt;0.05) different in all the treatments but was significantly (P&amp;lt;0.05) lower than that of fish in the control. Condition factor of &lt;em&gt;C. anguillaris &lt;/em&gt;in both the treated and untreated domestic sewage varied and decreased except for fish in 100% treated domestic sewage which was observed to have an increase in the value of the condition factor from 3.76g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; to 4.73g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;. Untreated domestic sewage water showed a higher turbidity, biochemical Oxygen Demand (B.O.D), alkalinity and nitrate composition of than treated sewage which had higher oxygen content and was clearer in appearance than the untreated. Microbial analysis shows the presence of &lt;em&gt;Escherichia fecalis, Streptococcus fecalis &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Enterococcus fecalis &lt;/em&gt;in untreated sewage with ciliated protozoans in both treated and untreated sewage. This study has shown that treated domestic sewage is best for healthy fish growth with reduced risk of transfer of pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Since 2005s, agricultural land in northern Laos has become to be dominated by maize mono-cropping. The rapid expansion of this commercial crop has the resulted of policy implementations and demand of maize from the neighboring countries. The purpose of this study was aim to analyze the impact of commercial agricultural policy and socio-economic factors influencing on maize production in Houyxai Distirct, Bokeo Province of Laos. A survey of 98 maize farmers by face to face interviews was conducted in September 2010. Ordinary Least Square regression model was applied in order to explain how these policies and socio-economic factors effect to farmers and contribute to maize production. The results revealed that 94% of the variation in maize production (ton) is explained by the selected explanatory variables. Seven variables have a positive significant and one variable has a negative effect on maize production volume. The results also demonstrated that the most important effect to maize production is a “policy push” mainly variables of farmland, farmer organization, support market and credit access and a “market pull” by private sectors with providing input factors namely seeds, land preparation and techniques. Therefore, the government should look at the way of credit providing system that may effect in high production cost, at the same time the expansion of farm size is needed to take into account.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;To assess the nitrogen pollution load potential (NPLP) of groundwater, mass balance over a recent five-year period (2006–2010) was analyzed within the Tedori River alluvial fan area, Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan. All components of the hydrologic cycle in polluted regions of the study area were analyzed based on water and nitrogen balance. The water balance model was based on the exchange of river water between the channel/soil surface and the aquifer horizon fractions. The water balance calculation was conducted by considering precipitation, evapotranspiration, direct runoff, and infiltration in the channel/soil horizon (Figure 2). In addition, infiltration from paddy and other land uses, recharge and effluent from the Tedori River and pumping from the wells in the aquifer horizon were considered. Based on the water balance analysis, nitrogen balance analysis was conducted. The results revealed that the nitrogen input was 1,214.2 ton/year, while nitrogen output was 959.4 ton/year. Therefore, 254.6 ton/year accumulated within the study area. In the aquifer horizon, the amount of nitrogen deposited was found to be 232.9 ton/year. The total nitrogen concentration of water samples collected from a well with a depth of 50 m was about 1.0 mg/L, which was greater than that observed for the well of 150 m depth (about 0.25 mg/L). These findings indicate that contaminating nitrogen gradually percolates into the deeper zone. The most dominant nitrogen pollutant for the study area originated from farmland (30.5%) and second is intake water (24.2%) and third is precipitation (23.8%). These three items occupied 78.5% of total pollutant.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Laboratory study was carried out to investigate the efficacy of hymenopteran parasitoids, (&lt;em&gt;Dinarmus basalis&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Choetospila elegans)&lt;/em&gt; parasitization of &lt;em&gt;Callosobruchus maculatus&lt;/em&gt; on cowpea (&lt;em&gt;Vigna unguiculata&lt;/em&gt;) seeds in the Department of Crop Science, University of Calabar, Nigeria. Treatments were the inoculation of &lt;em&gt;D. basalis&lt;/em&gt; (sole), &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; (sole), a mixture of &lt;em&gt;D. basalis&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; into infested cowpea seeds and the control which received no parasitoids. The introduction of parasitoids was repeated at 3 d interval, and all treatments were replicated 3 times. Result indicated that early introduction of the parasitoids caused significantly (P ? 0.05) higher mortality of &lt;em&gt;C.maculatus&lt;/em&gt; than late introduction. Mix culture of both parasitoids was significantly more efficacious than sole culture. The emergence of each parasitoid and the mortality of &lt;em&gt;C. maculatus&lt;/em&gt; in sole culture showed a highly significant (P ? 0.01) positive relationship (r = 0.487) between &lt;em&gt;C. maculatus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;D. basalis&lt;/em&gt; but non-significant (P ? 0.05) though positive association (r = 0.289) with &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt;. A multiple regression analysis between &lt;em&gt;C. maculatus &lt;/em&gt;mortality and the emergence of the two parasitoids in mix culture also indicated a highly positive significant (P ? 0.01) relationship (R = 0.751, R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.564). Pearson Correlation analysis also showed a significant (P ? 0.05) positive association (r = 0.464, and 0.401) between &lt;em&gt;C. maculatus&lt;/em&gt; mortality and emergence of &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;D. basalis&lt;/em&gt; in mix culture, respectively. However, a non significant (P ? 0.05) negative relationship (r = -0.336) was observed between the two parasitoids in their emergence in mix culture, but &lt;em&gt;D. basalis&lt;/em&gt; contributed more to the mortality of &lt;em&gt;C. maculatus&lt;/em&gt; than &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt;. Data from this study showed that &lt;em&gt;D. basalis&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; have potentials to be deployed as biological control entities in the management of &lt;em&gt;C. maculatus&lt;/em&gt; as a part of the integrated pest management strategies of storage pests in the tropics.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;In this research paper a Constant Market Share (CMS) approach was employed to learn export performance dynamics of Indian seafood (shrimps and cephalopods) in the major export destinations (EU, USA and select Asian countries), which accounts for a sizeable market for Indian seafood. The Constant Market Share model was used to disintegrate the growth in exports of seafood into market size effect, market composition effect and competitiveness effect. The analysis was performed for the seafood exports for a span of 12 years from the year 1996 to the year 2007, the period during which India had to face severe challenges from evolving food safety regulations in the EU and USA. The analysis was extended to account for the competitiveness at dis-aggregated commodity level. In the present study we observed enhanced competitiveness in the case of cephalopods while shrimp exports were less competitive. To a certain extent it shows that trade facilitating as well as trade restricting effects can coexist as an impact of strict food safety regulations.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Limited knowledge is available regarding how the subsistence-oriented agricultural production in Nigeria is practiced in order to provide policy guides for its future development. This study focused on the cropping patterns, enterprise combination and the nature of costs and returns on subsistence farming practices with a view to determining the major variables affecting the farm’s economic performance. Data analyzed were obtained from farm survey covering the two major vegetation zones in south western Nigeria. Frequency tables, correlation matrix and regression were used as analytical tools. Results showed that subsistence farming is not absolutely un-profitable but for the fact that farmers operate at sub-optimal levels. Farmers believed that farming was profitable by their subjective evaluation and because it satisfies their subsistence needs. Organized and guided programmes of increasing farm size; reducing labour cost and improving farming techniques could serve as saviours to enhance income on subsistence farms.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total consumption of fresh vegetables in Swaziland is estimated around 40,000 tonnes per year and this translate into 40 kg per capita consumption per year. Individuals who are not economically challenged consume above the annual per capita of 40 kg in contrast to a poor individuals living in rural areas, who consume less than the per capita vegetables. The study sought to describe the performance of vegetable vegetables supply chain in Swaziland. A descriptive research design was used in the study and data were collected using personal interviews from 100 randomly selected vegetable farmers. Data were analysed using market margins and marketing channel analysis to identify existing marketing channels used by vegetable farmers. The revealed marketing channels that producers used to obtain attractive prices and a higher share of the consumer price. The largest producer’s share was obtained through direct sale to consumers. Channels that included restaurants had high total gross margins and low producer’s share of the consumer price. The concern for issues on post-harvest and marketing should form an integral part of policy development and research programmes and also the public and private sectors should facilitate contractual arrangements for vegetables farmers. Commercialising vegetable production should not be overemphasised because it encourages farmers to be market oriented as opposed to production oriented. Farmers need to form cooperatives in order to assist in bargaining of prices within the vegetable supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vegetables as a group of horticultural crops are important for their contribution as an income support to a large proportion of the rural households. However, enhancing vegetable farmers to reach markets and actively engage in the markets is a key challenge influencing vegetable production in Swaziland. The perishable nature of vegetables necessitates effective marketing channels. The aim of this paper was to investigate factors affecting farmers’ choice of marketing channels using survey data gathered during the 2011 production season. Data were collected from 100 randomly selected vegetable farmers. Descriptive and multinomial logistic regression analyses were used. The results indicated that age of the farmer, quantity of baby corn produced and level of education were significant predictors of the choice to sell vegetables to NAMBoard market channel instead of selling to other-wholesale market channel. The age of the farmer, distance from production area to market, membership in farmer organization and marketing agreement were significant determinants of the choice to use non-wholesale market channel over other-wholesale market channel. It is therefore important to promote collective action as an institutional vehicle for linking farmers to agribusiness supply chains. Farmers should establish networks since they aid in sharing knowledge, farmers can improve produce grades as required by market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;The study sought to establish the contribution of beekeeping in rural livelihoods sustainability. Chitanga village had experienced low agricultural productivity due to poor and infertile soils and this has led to food insecurity which had driven them into beekeeping. This opportunity has been driven by the existence of tall trees and wild plants that develop flowers in the village which attracted bees. However, the utility of beekeeping enterprise as a livelihood activity has not been fully realised. This study was carried out in the context of a sustainable rural livelihoods framework. This framework states that at any given time, every community or society falls under a vulnerability context as a result of both natural and human made disasters. In light of the vulnerability, a community mobilises the various forms of its assets at its disposal to earn a living. Applying this framework, the study analysed the strategies the community employed to enhance its livelihoods through the sharing of benefits. The research used questionnaires, structured interviews and observations as sources of gathering data. The study established the benefits which accrued from beekeeping that included honey as food, income in the form of cash, medicines, scenery creation for tourism and income generating projects through making of hives, growing of flowers and citrus fruits which attract bees. A backward and forward linkage of enterprises emerged. Employment creation and increasing in the number of livelihood activities in the area has been witnessed due to beekeeping. This culminated in diversification of livelihood options leading to rural transformation through utilization of local available resources. The study recommends that the sustainability of beekeeping enterprise should be reinforced by backward and forward linkages. The government partnered by NGOs should take the lead and compliment the efforts of beekeepers by providing clear policy and planning.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, about 12x10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; ha of arable land are destroyed and abandoned annually due to soil erosion. This problem is very serious for Krasnogvardeiskiy district, which is most eroded district (72.7% eroded lands) in the Central Chernozem Zone (CCZ) of Russia. Under the leadership of the academician of Russian Academy  of Agrarian Sciences O.G. Kotlyarova the landscape agricultural systems (LASs) were mastered throughout the Krasnogvardeisky district (132 thousand ha). Our investigations showed that the purpose for which LASs were created is reached. Obtained results showed that it is possible to prevent erosive losses and to raise soil fertility. Restoration of soil fertility is presented in terms of increasing of crops productivity-on 25%. Transformation of a landscape basis has increased the general biological capacity of territory more than twice and exchangeable biological capacity by 32%. All these facts have raised assimilability of the transformed territory that allows to consider it, unlike traditional, not as source ??&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in atmosphere, and as fixed carbon tank which capacity can reach 0,71 t/ha. In turn the intensification of substances circulation leads to increasing of plant production efficiency. Excess is from 14% (productivity of labour expenses) to 43.2% (use efficiency of PAR). In intensively mastered agricultural district (arable lands more than 80%) agroecosystems have been formed, allowing besides its basic function: soil preservation, steady reception of agricultural production, to carry out also the major biospheric function - increasing biological variety, creation of a favorable inhabitancy for live organisms, including human.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;This study was carried out to analyze the comparative analysis of efficiencies of artisanal fisheries in Ijebu Waterside of Ogun State. The objectives determined gross margin analysis; estimate the technical efficiencies of both the manually propelled technology (MPT) and motorized technology (MT) of artisanal fishery systems and determining the factors influencing the technical efficiencies of artisanal fisheries in the study area. A multistage sampling technique was used to select a total of 400 Artisans from the study area. Primary data were collected using structured questionnaire as interview guide, on the socio-economic characteristics, production inputs and output prices. The data collected were analyzed using both descriptive and inferential statistics. Stochastic production frontier model was used to estimate the technical, efficiencies of both motorized and manually propelled technologies in artisanal fishery system as well as the factors influencing the technical, efficiencies of the artisans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The results of the comparison of the MPT and (MT) revealed that the average income per month for MPT was N361,847.48 and the amount accruable per month for the MT was N560,755.57. The results of the comparison of catch efficiency and inefficiency function showed that in MPT, fishing gear, vessel length, number of crew/skippers, quantity of bait and battery were all significant at 5 percent probability level while for MT, fishing gear, outboard engine, battery and miscellaneous quantity were the significant factors. The mean catch efficiency of MPT was 0.92 compared to MT with 0.98. However, the comparison of the inefficiency shows that education, age, and household size are significant factors while education is significant factors in both MPT and MT respectively. The results of the returns-to-scale revealed that the parameters estimate of the MT was higher with 4.35 compared to MPT with 2.56.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;A field experiment was carried out during the spring seasons of 2008-09 and 2009-10 at Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh to find out exact time of earthing up with level of earthing up and optimum doses of nitrogen for getting higher productivity, monetary returns, and changes in the fertility status of soils after harvest of ratoon sugarcane (&lt;em&gt;Saccharum officinarum&lt;/em&gt; L.). Twentieth fifth April earthed crop produced significantly more height of tillers, leaf area index at maximum tillering stage, grand growth stage and at harvest, dry matter/tiller at maximum tillering stage at grand growth stage and at harvest, cane length, cane diameter of top, middle and bottom, weight of cane, cane yield, monetary returns, B/C ratio, N, P and K uptake except number of tillers/ha, number of millable cane/ha and net available soil nutrient after the harvest of ratoon crops as compared to 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; May and 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; June respectively. Twentieth cm height of earthing up from the ridge also significantly increased all the above parameters such as height of tillers, LAI of maximum tillering stage, grand growth stage and harvest, dry matter/tiller at maximum tillering stage, grand growth stage and at harvest, cane length, weight of cane and cane yield than that of 10 cm earthed crop in both the ratoon crops. Application of 210 kg N/ha linearly and significantly increased number of tillers/ha at 60 and 120 days after ratooning, height of tillers at 120 days after ratooning, LAI at maximum tillering stage, grand growth stage, and at harvest, dry matter/tiller at maximum tillering stage, grand growth stage and at harvest, number of millable cane, cane length, cane weight, cane yield, monetary returns, B/C ratio and N, P, K uptake followed by 180 kg N/ha. Ratoon crop showed that there was a build up of nitrogen and phosphorous but depletion in potassium content of the soil. 210 kg N/ha with earlier earthed at 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; April to a level of 20 cm was found optimum for obtaining higher yields and monetary returns.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;The Nigerian rural population is described by low productivity, little formal education and poverty. The need for more studies on the issue of wellbeing of rural population is hinged on the continued development of approaches that give better understanding of the phenomenon. This paper attempted to use Amartya Sen’s capability approach to assess multidimensional well being in rural Nigeria in six functioning dimensions obtained from the Nigerian Core Welfare Indices Survey using the fuzzy set theory. A binary logistic regression was also carried out to isolate the factors that determine the attainment of a pre determined level of well being after computation with the fuzzy set analysis. The results showed that rural Nigeria is an agrarian society; the functioning with the highest level of achievement out of the six dimensions studied was Housing, while asset ownership/income was the least achieved dimension in rural Nigeria. Results further revealed that belonging to female headed households, increasing age and being employed in the private (formal) sector as well as having some form of post secondary education enhances well being while being employed within the agricultural sector significantly reduced the well being of rural households in Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Continuous cultivation of farms has led to decline in soil fertility due to constant removal of nutrients leading to reduction of carrot (Daucus carota L.)&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;yields. A field study was carried out at Egerton University, Horticulture Research and Teaching field in two seasons (October 2010 to January 2011 and February to May 2011) with the aim of investigating the effects of decomposed cattle bio-slurry manure on carrot growth and performance. The experimental design was a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with 3 replications. Treatments comprised four levels (0, 2.6, 5.2 and 7.8 t/ha) of decomposed bio-slurry manure. Growth, yield and quality parameters were recorded and used to discern the treatment effects. Application of bio-slurry manure generally improved growth, yield and quality of carrots. Application of 7.8 t/ha of bio-slurry increased yields by 8.8% in season 1 and 23.5% in season 2 compared to the control. Leaf numbers, plant height, dry weights of shoot and roots and root volume were also generally higher for the 7.8 t/ha treatment compared to other treatments. Total Soluble Solids of roots from plant treated with 7.8 t/ha were higher by 12.7% in season 1 and 13.2% in season 2 compared to the control. The study recommends 7.8 t/ha of bio-slurry manure for enhanced yield and quality of carrot.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was the determination of the level of ochratoxin A (OTA) in cocoa beans and derived products along with the estimation of the dietary intake in adults. Throughout harvesting seasons from 2005 to 2009, as many as 1895 samples of cocoa beans were collected at ports and areas of cocoa production and thereafter analyzed. OTA concentrations were determined by HPLC according to the standards of the European Communities (CE 401/2006). OTA intakes were assessed using data obtained from the analysis and the estimated Ivorian adult daily consumptions of cocoa beans and chocolate. Average OTA levels depending on cocoa grades were as follows: 0.64±0.53 µg/kg for marketable beans, 1.90±1.87 µg/kg for non-marketable beans and 1.40±1.32 µg/kg for total beans). As regards the types of beans, OTA concentrations ranged from 0.19±0.16 µg/kg (shelled beans) to 1.90±1.87 µg/kg (unshelled beans). OTA levels in beans were below the maximum concentration of OTA allowed (2 µg/kg of beans).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Besides, OTA concentrations obtained from chocolate were comprised between 0.048±0.040 µg/kg for sweet chocolate made from marketable shelled beans and 0.66±0.65 µg/kg for dark chocolate made from non-marketable unshelled beans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dietary intakes were respectively equal to 3.70±3.00 pg/kg body weight/day for the marketable shelled beans and 36.5±34.0 pg/kg body weight/day for the unshelled non-marketable beans. Those dietary intakes appeared to be by far lower than the Tolerable Daily Intake set by the Scientific Committee o Food (5000 pg/kg body weight/day). However, in view of the toxicity of OTA, it is imperative to foster best practices of harvesting, pod breaking, drying and storage of the beans for the total elimination of OTA from Ivorian cocoa beans.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Smoke-water (SW) had been reported to improve the growth of &lt;em&gt;Isatis indigotica&lt;/em&gt;, a Chinese medicinal plant. However, there were very few reports on the mechanism of smoke-water improving plant growth. In this study the effects of smoke-water on the photosynthetic characteristics of &lt;em&gt;I.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; indigotica&lt;/em&gt; seedlings were investigated for the purpose of understanding the mechanism behind this improved plant growth. The results showed that net photosynthetic rate (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) was increased by smoke-water, reaching a maximum on 15, 5 and 15 d after treatment with smoke-water at dilutions of 1:500, 1:1000 and 1:2000 respectively. Transpiration rate (&lt;em&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) and stomatal conductance (&lt;em&gt;G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) both showed similar trends to&lt;sub&gt; &lt;/sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, however, intercellular CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) was decreased with smoke-water treatment. The F&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;/F&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; was not significantly influenced by smoke-water treatment. The ?PSII was markedly promoted with the application of smoke-water (1:1000) compared with the control and the coefficient of photochemical quenching (qP) showed a similar trend to ?PSII. However the coefficient of non-photochemical quenching of chlorophyll (NPQ) was decreased with treatment of smoke-water. These findings indicate that smoke-water treatment induce an increase in photosynthesis and suggest the main factors leading to this might be the improved stomatal conductance and the enhanced level of the photochemical efficiency of PSII in leaves.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Nigeria is blessed with natural and human resources required to produce rice to meet its local consumption. These resources are spread across all the agro-ecological zones of the country. Despite the availability of these resources, rice production in Nigeria could still not meet the local consumption and over 40% of the crop is imported annually to complement the local production. Several studies have revealed biotic and abiotic stresses as the major impediment to the production of the crop. Weeds are the most prominent of all the stresses across all the ecologies in term of yield reduction, labour demand and control cost. Yield losses of 35-75% and 70-100% have been recorded in low land and upland ecologies respectively as a result of weed interference. The problem of weed is worse than any of the other stress mentioned above except for water stress in low land ecology. This paper reviews the various weed management options that could be adopted for optimal rice yield, by the resource poor farmers of Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aloe secundiflora &lt;/em&gt;Synonym: &lt;em&gt;Aloe floramaculata, Aloe marsabitensis, Aloe engleri&lt;/em&gt; belongs to the family &lt;em&gt;Asphodelaceae.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Aloe&lt;/em&gt; leaf gel and &lt;em&gt;Aloe&lt;/em&gt; exudates are the main components. The gel is derived from parenchytomous cells while exudates are derived from the inner epidermal layers. The gel consists of mainly polysaccharides while the exudates consists of a mixture of phenolic compounds mainly athrones, chromones and phenyl pyrones. Leaf components of &lt;em&gt;Aloe&lt;/em&gt; have been credited for antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral and anthelmintic medicinal properties. The effectiveness of &lt;em&gt;Aloe secundiflora &lt;/em&gt;extracts on the most prevalent nematode of chicken &lt;em&gt;Ascaridia galli&lt;/em&gt; was conducted &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. The results of this study indicate that Hexane, Ethylacetate, Acetone, Methanol and chloroform extracts were found active in hindering the development of &lt;em&gt;Ascaridia galli&lt;/em&gt; eggs to larval stage three (L&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), and this was dependent on the concentration of the crude extract. The lowest concentration of the various extracts (5 mg/ml) had an inhibition percent (IP), 75.52%, 79.60%, 87.21%, 86.13% and 43.6% respectively. The highest concentration of the extracts was (50 mg/ml), at this level the inhibition percent was found higher than in the lowest extracts concentrations i.e., 91.84%, 97.55%, 100%, 99.46% and 91.29% respectively. &lt;em&gt;Aloe secundiflora&lt;/em&gt; extracts therefore have inhibitory effects on the &lt;em&gt;Ascaridia galli&lt;/em&gt; larval development &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;. Phytochemical tests on the extracts revealed the presence of various chemical compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;The state government of Chiapas in Mexico is promoting the cultivation of jatropha by farmers as a source of biofuel, with the first harvest expected in 2012. However, despite the fact that the planted jatropha has now reached the harvesting stage, no reports exist on the current status of jatropha cultivation in Chiapas or on issues related to cultivation. We accordingly conducted a study aimed at ascertaining the current status of jatropha cultivation and identifying factors impeding its spread. For the study, we conducted a questionnaire survey among 88 farmers of 7 villages located within 3 municipalities, and also interviewed them. Our study pointed to 2 key factors causing the abandonment of jatropha cultivation, namely the failure of farmers to receive ProArbol payments as financial assistance for cultivation, and damage caused to jatropha roots by gophers. Pest/disease outbreaks, lack of technical assistance, lack of trust for extension workers and distrust for the project were also obstacles to the spread of jatropha cultivation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Changes in the concentrations and retention levels of total and individual provitamin A carotenoids (pVACs) during ripening and local processing of the four most popular &lt;em&gt;Musa&lt;/em&gt; cultivars of Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo were established through HPLC analysis. The predominant pVACs were all &lt;em&gt;trans&lt;/em&gt; ?- and ?-carotene, together constituting about 90% of total pVACs content in raw and processed &lt;em&gt;Musa&lt;/em&gt; fruit pulp. The proportion of ?- and ?-carotene was not significantly different in the tested East African Highland Bananas (AAA-EAHB) (‘Nshikazi’ and ‘Vulambya’); in the plantains (‘Musilongo’ and ‘Musheba’), proportion of ?-carotene was almost twice that of ?-carotene. An increase in total pVACs was observed during ripening, with highest levels at ripening stage 3 in all four cultivars. Total pVACs values were as high as 1081µg/100gfw in ‘Vulambya’ and 1819µg/100gfw in ‘Musilongo’. Boiling of the AAA-EAHB and AAB-Plantains resulted to retention of between 40-90% and &amp;gt;95% respectively. Plantains deep-fried in fully-refined palm oil and crude red palm oil for 2 minutes did not seem to lose any pVACs, the levels of total pVACs observed after frying were 100% of what was observed when the fruit was raw. Retinol Activity Equivalents (RAE), in boiled products varied between 22.3 and 173 RAEµg/100gfw, whereas deep fried products had &amp;gt;190 RAEµg/100g edible portion. These results show that the tested AAA-EAHBs and the plantains could meet at least 14% and 30 % of Vitamin A recommended dietary intakes respectively. The findings can therefore guide consumer consumption patterns to maximize vitamin A intake for improved health in these regions and also direct researchers in the selection of &lt;em&gt;Musa&lt;/em&gt; cultivars to be incorporated within existing farming systems in the fight against vitamin A deficiency (VAD).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;The objective of this study is to get a better understanding and accurate information regarding factors affecting the forestland transfer, providing first-hand information, and proposing policy implications. The forestland use transfer is the main content in the collective forest tenure reform in China at present. Individual household, as a basic unit of forest production, should be the major participant in the forestland transfer. Using survey data of 329 rural household in 18 villages of three counties, this paper analyzes influencing factors on rural householders’ willingness to partake in forestland use right transfer by employing Binary Logit Regression. Nineteen variables, which were identified as characteristics of householders and households, natural endowment of forestland resources and householders’s awareness of forestland policy. Results indicate that householders’ awareness of pertinent policies and population of the household demonstrate significantly positive effects, while forestland area owned by individual household shows a markedly negative effect on peasants’ willingness to participate in forestland transfer. Some policy implications are discussed in this paper.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;The study examined price variation in the marketing of garri in Delta State Nigeria. A multi-stage sampling procedure was used in drawing up a sample of 180 garri marketers from six purposively selected major garri markets each from six purposively selected Local government areas. Data collected with the aid of questionnaire were analysed using both descriptive and inferential statistics. The results revealed that majority of the marketers were females that are still in their economically active age group and relatively literate. Majority of the marketers were middlemen who sold mostly to their fellow middlemen. Most of the respondents agreed that marketing cost is the major cause of price variation in garri market while season of the year was the most notable problem facing garri marketers in the study area. Also, the result of Analysis of Variance revealed that there were significant differences in garri prices among the six markets. It was concluded that in order to stabilize price of garri and income of garri marketers, in order to ensure sustainable food security in Delta State, measures should be taken to provide adequate transportation and establish storage facilities. This will invariably cut down marketing costs.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;This paper investigated the extent of knowledge sharing by cocoa FFS graduates farmers in Edo State with other cocoa farmers. The objectives of the study included to: ascertain the extent of knowledge sharing by FFS farmers, the nature of knowledge shared and the number of beneficiaries from the shared knowledge. A multistage sampling procedure was used to collect data from 68 respondents. A well structured questionnaire was used for data collection. Simple descriptive statistics (frequency counts and percentages) and logit regression were used to analyze the data. The results of the study showed that there was no significant sharing of knowledge by the FFS farmers with other farmers as only 13(19.1%) FFS farmers were involved in knowledge sharing. The logit regression result showed that all the socio-economic variables except household size and farm size were insignificant in influencing the FFS farmers’ knowledge sharing abilities. From the findings of the study, it was therefore recommended that FFS graduate farmers should be encouraged to sign knowledge sharing contract, to organize field day and the need for FFS facilitators to monitor the graduates to ensure that the contractual agreement is adhered to should be stressed.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;The agricultural sector of Andean countries like Peru and Bolivia perceives the consequences of climate change in increasing water stress due to melting glaciers and changing precipitation patterns. Therefore mainly subsistence agricultural systems are increasingly vulnerable. Traditional inhabitants of the tropical Andean region are aware of the recurrent diversity of climate related impacts and its consequences, thus livelihood strategies are based on principles of risk management. Andean farmers are nowadays applying traditional strategies in a combination of homegrown experimentation and scientific know-how to cope with and adapt to a changing climate. Understanding these adaptations has become one of the most important aspects of research into climate change impacts and vulnerability. It provides essential knowledge for developing and transferring strategies towards a sustainable management in agriculture and agroforestry systems. But there still is a lack of a comparative assessment, especially in regions with high impact of extreme climate conditions. The endogenously determined strategies, which are based on the experience of the farmers, are to be complemented by knowledge and experiences coming from outside farm-household systems and communities. In a collaborative way, this exogenous knowledge is to be placed at the disposal of local actors. The necessary network approach leads to a comprehensive involvement of local stakeholders. Therefore a participative network on climate change may work as a tool to bridge the gap between the global discourse on climate change and local action.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Striga&lt;/em&gt; spp. is considered to be the greatest biological constraint to food production in sub-Saharan Africa, a more serious problem than insects, birds and plant diseases. They are among the most specialized root-parasitic plants inflicting serious injury to their host depriving them water, minerals and photosynthate. The greatest diversity of &lt;em&gt;Striga &lt;/em&gt;spp. occurs in grassland. However, &lt;em&gt;Striga hermonthica&lt;/em&gt; mainly occurs in farmland infecting grasses. The parasite devastating effect is accomplished prior to its emergence from the soil. It may cause yield losses in cereals ranging from 15% under favourable conditions to 100% where several stress factors are involved, thereby affecting the livelihood of millions of resource-poor farmers. Piecemeal approach to address one aspect of &lt;em&gt;Striga&lt;/em&gt; problem at a time has been a setback in technology transfer to producers. Future &lt;em&gt;Striga&lt;/em&gt; control programs should not be conducted separately, but should rather be conducted in an integrated approach that combines research talents of various institutions. This will facilitate collaborative research and achieve qualitative interaction between stakeholders, which can easily produce reliable technologies that are practical and available to farmers. &lt;em&gt;Striga&lt;/em&gt; being a pervasive pest, time is of essence in controlling it. There is an urgent need for the establishment of policies to promote, implement, and ensure a long-term sustainable &lt;em&gt;Striga&lt;/em&gt; control program.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;A cross sectional survey design was set up to assess the influence of household procurement strategies on food intake and nutritional status of preschool children in from 196 households in Vihiga County, Kenya. Dietary diversity was positively correlated with food availability (p&amp;lt;0.05). Increased consumption of bread and cereals, and, fruits and vegetables was influenced by food availability and food consumption (dietary diversity) (&amp;lt;0.05). Roots and tubers, legumes and pulses, and carbonated drinks were the main contributors to food procurement strategies and availability (F= 3.419, F sig=0.02). Nutrition outcome was influenced by household socioeconomic status (R= 0.189, p value = 0.012) and income levels of households (R= 0.246, p value= 0.002), while procurement strategies had no effect on the nutritional status of the pre-school child. Household income levels determined food availability, diversity and intake.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;In Kenya, maize (&lt;em&gt;Zea mays&lt;/em&gt; L.) is mainly grown on acid soils in high rainfall areas. These soils are known for low available phosphorus (P), partly due to its sorption by aluminium (Al) and iron oxides. The study determined soil P sorption, lime requirements and the effects of lime on soil pH, Al levels and available P on the main maize growing acids soils in the highlands east and west of Rift Valley (RV), Kenya. Burnt lime containing 21% calcium oxide was used. The soils were strongly to extremely acid (pH 4.85-4.07), had high exchangeable Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (&amp;gt; 2 cmol Al kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) and Al saturation (&amp;gt; 20% Al), which most maize germplasm grown in Kenya are sensitive to. The base cations, cation exchange capacity and available P (&amp;lt; 10 mg P kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; bicarbonate extractable P) were low, except at one site in the highlands east of RV indicative with history of high fertilizer applications. Highlands east of RV soils had higher P sorption (343-402 mg P kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) than the west (107-258 mg P kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), probably because of their high Al&lt;sup&gt;3+ &lt;/sup&gt;ions&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;and also the energies of bonding between the soil colloids and phosphate ions. Highlands east of RV also had higher lime requirements (11.4-21.9 tons lime ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) than the west (5.3-9.8 tons lime ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). Due to differences in soil acidity, Al levels and P sorption capacities within and between highlands east and west of RV, blanket P fertilizer and lime recommendations may not serve all soils equally well.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Australia’s land managers will need specific information about the best locations at which to sequester carbon if they are to take advantage of the recent Carbon Farming Initiative of the Australian Government under which carbon offsets can be created through sequestration of carbon in soil and trees. The literature indicates that soil texture and previous landuse are important determinants of soil carbon content. This paper describes the results of work to assess the current levels of soil carbon and the extent to which they vary with previous landuse and soil texture in the Namoi Catchment Management Authority in North West NSW, Australia. Soil samples were taken at 74 sites for determination of soil carbon concentration and stocks as well as soil texture and landuse in the last 10 years. There was wide variation between sites in soil carbon concentration and stocks which were greatest in those soils which had not been disturbed by cultivation and in soils with higher clay content. Thus, the greatest potential for carbon sequestration is in soils with the lowest carbon concentration, those which have been previously disturbed, and with higher clay content. Maintaining any increased carbon concentration will depend on minimizing disturbance, increased carbon input and minimizing loss of carbon through soil erosion. As these factors all vary significantly on a regional and landscape basis it will be important for land managers to have access to information which allows them to choose the sites at which potential for sequestration of soil carbon is greatest.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Boron insufficiency in the agricultural soils is common and wide spread problem in many regions of the world. The effectiveness of crushed ore colemanite as B sources for rice crop under flooded calcareous soil were evaluated in a glass house study. We studied the effects of powder colemanite (PC) and granular colemanite (GC) in comparison with the refined sodium pentaborate fertilizer at the rates of 0, 1, 2, and 3 kg B ha&lt;sup&gt;-1 &lt;/sup&gt;on growth and yield parameters of rice crop as well as the true control (0 kg B ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). Sodium pentaborate (SP) and (PC) application of 2 and 3 kg B ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; significantly increased the plant height, number of tillers and panicles per plant, number of grains per panicle, weight of 1000 grains and B concentration in grain compared the 0 and 1 kg B ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Rice crop with SP and PC applied at 3 kg B ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; produced significantly (18% over the control) higher grain yield than the 0 kg B ha&lt;sup&gt;-1 &lt;/sup&gt;treatment. Pots fertilized with SP and PC produced similar results as grain yield difference between them was not significant so these B fertilizers were very effective in supplying B to rice crop, but GC applied pots produced significantly low yield because of its bigger particle size, due to which B was not released from fertilizer. This study proved that colemanite with smaller particle size is an effective B source and it is cheaper than refined products so it should be applied for harvesting higher yields.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;em&gt;Pachnoda interrupta&lt;/em&gt; is one of the head-infesting insect pests of sunflower in Maiduguri. Two separate field experiment(one each for sowing date effect and threshold level) were conducted to investigate the influence of sowing date on damage and yield loss by &lt;em&gt;P. interrupta&lt;/em&gt; on sunflower and the economic threshold level for its control in Maiduguri. The result for influence of sowing date experiment shows that percentage incidence of infestation was highly significant on sunflower sown on the 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; July than other planting date except that of 26&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; July. Significantly lower damage was recorded on sunflower sown on 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; July than those on the 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and grain yield loss was also significantly higher on 26&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; July sowings than all other dates. The results for economic threshold level experiment indicated that 2.38 and 2.36 beetles/head were the economic threshold level for flowing and milky grain stage respectively and there was a 1:4.9 cost: benefit ratio/ ha. This means that there is a 20% return for every unit of inputs. The result implies that 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of July is the best planting date to reduce infestations, damage and yield loss from &lt;em&gt;P. interrupta&lt;/em&gt; in Maiduguri and artificial control measures should be initiated when there are 1.9 to 2.0 beetles/plant.</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Women play significant roles generally in urban agricultural production. In spite of their roles, women farmers are faced with myriads of challenges that affect their increased production in the urban areas. This study assessed the challenges of women farming in urban areas with reference to Kwara State, Nigeria. A total of 1,801 women farmers were sampled from different urban areas in the state. Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were organized for them in order to explore their minds on the challenges faced and opportunities available to them in urban agricultural production. The matrix ranking revealed lack of credit facilities as one of the most important challenges militating against increased production by women. Other challenges identified include restricted accessibility to land and lack of farm input among others. Appropriate recommendations were made that production resources should be made available especially for women farmers while women should also be part of decision making concerning agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">Agriculture in North Carolina contributes to 19 percent of the state’s income and employs over 20 percent of the work force. Agricultural activities are significant in rural counties and nearly 30 percent of the total population of North Carolina lives in 85 rural counties. Individuals in these rural counties have less income, education, and employment opportunities eventually in high poverty and unemployment rates. The objective of this study is to examine the potential use of agriculture in economic growth of North Carolina using county level data. Data were gathered from U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and U.S. Census Bureau for the period of 2000 to 2010. A system of simultaneous equations is used for the analysis. Results highlight that increasing income increases agricultural activities and vise versa. Thus, the counties with high household income levels are more capable of incorporating agriculture in economic growth while the counties with significant agricultural activities are more competent of improving income levels. Overall, results conclude the importance of secured satisfactory level of income through agriculture to enhance economic growth.</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Micro Finance Institutions (MFIs) rejuvenate economic prowess in developing countries, after severe shocks like wars, droughts and floods. MFIs are a promising tool to tackle poverty and improve food security. Sustainability of MFIs based on their capital structure ensures sustainability in poverty reduction and improved food security. The limited literature on the impacts of capital structures on MFI performance necessitated the study. Panel data from 14 MFIs was collected based on availability and accessibility. The sources of data were financial and income statements covering five years. Econometric analysis using STATA software was done following methodologies of Bogan and Rosenberg. MFIs lent to both individuals and groups and 79% were not regulated by the Central Bank, 86% had their funding sources as loans, grants, excluding deposits/savings and 73% attained operational self-sufficiency. Debt and grants were negatively correlated to operational and financial sustainability. When sustainability was more constricted to financial sustainability, debt and share capital remained noteworthy. Other than grants, debt was paid back on competitive market interest rates most especially debts from money lenders, whereas share capital fetched in revenues to the MFIs at market interest rates from the borrowers. Grants and debt had a substantialdamagingconsequence on MFI performance. Capital structure was essential in MFIs’ sustainability. MFI specific characteristics, like management were also important. Subject to sampling uncertainties, the results indicate that adding to regulation by Central Bank, MFIs must specialize their lending to reduce portfolio at risk. MFIs must reduce dependence on debts and grants and resort to accumulating share capital for long-term sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;An experiment was conducted during the dry seasons in western Hararghe Zone, Eastern Ethiopia at the Haramaya University Chiro Campus to determine the effect of maize stover as soil mulch on yield of Arabica coffee. Five levels of maize stover as soil mulch at a rate of: 0t/ha, 2t/ha, 4t/ha, 6t/ha and 8t/ha were applied in randomized complete block design with four replications from 2008 to 2011. Yield data was recorded during specific phenological stage of the plant. Result from the analysis of variance from the application of maize stover as soil mulch over years showed the presence of significant difference among treatments on bean yield of Arabica coffee. The highest bean yield (1070 kg/ha) and the lowest bean yield (520 kg/ha) were noted at 8 tons/ha and 0 ton/ha, respectively. Similarly, the pooled analysis of variance over seasons corroborated that the effect of maize stover as a soil mulch at a rate of 6t/ha and 8t/ha showed the presence of no significant difference on bean yield of coffee (p&amp;lt;0.05). The result of the present study also elucidated that, the unmulched control plots had the lowest coffee bean yield. While application of 8 tons/ha of maize stover as a soil mulch significantly increased coffee yield both in 2010 and 2011 cropping seasons. Therefore, on the basis of these results, it can be concluded that applying maize stover as soil mulch during the dry seasons at west Hararghe can help to sustain Arabica coffee production. Thus, it is recommended that application of 8tons/ha maize stover as soil mulch can significantly increase the yield of Arabica coffee and sustains its productivity over years.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Field experiment was conducted during the rainy seasons of 2011 and 2012 at the Teaching and Research Farm of the Faculty of Agriculture, Nasarawa State University, Keffi-Lafia Campus to study the competitive behaviour of groundnut in Sesame-groundnut intercropping system. The experiment consisted of four rates of poultry manure (0, 3.0, 6.0 and 9 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) and two planting arrangement (single alternate row and double alternate row planting arrangement). The eight treatment combinations were laid out in a randomized complete block design with four replications. The results obtained in both the years showed that sesame when grown with groundnut under different rates of poultry manure and planting arrangement appeared to be a dominant crop as indicated by its higher values of Land equivalent ratio, competitive ratio, higher and positive values for aggressivity and area time equivalent ratio. Application of 6 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of poultry manure and double alternate row planting arrangement produced the highest values for all the competition indices measured respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Due to the urgent need of differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals in control and eradication of classical swine fever (CSF) and the shortcomings of current differential diagnostic tools, this study is aiming to establish a RT-nestPCR assay for differential detection of wild-type viruses and lapinized Chinese vaccine strain (C-strain) of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) of high sensitivity. Two pairs of CSFV-specific primers were designed in the conservative regions of NS5B (a non-structural protein encoded by the CSFV genome, which performs the RNA dependent RNA polymerase activity) and 3? un-translated regions (3?-UTR) to encompass the T-rich insertion uniquely existing in the 3?-UTR of C-strain genome. Thus the amplification fragment of C-strain is longer than that of the wild-type viruses for it contains the T-rich insertion region. Two pairs of primers were used in combination and the wild-type viruses and C-strain of CSFV could be detected and accurately distinguished with a high sensitivity through super fine resolution (SFR) argarose gel electrophoresis that displays the different lengths of the amplicons. The detection limit of the C-strain and Shimen strain were respectively 4.5×10&lt;sup&gt;-2 &lt;/sup&gt;pg and 3.2×10&lt;sup&gt;-2 &lt;/sup&gt;pg of viral RNA. The results of the specificity test showed that this method can detect different strains of CSFV without amplifying other non-CSFV pathogens. The results of the detection of 400 clinical samples indicated that 16 samples were CSFV positive in total; in which 4 samples were C-Strain positive and 12 were wild-type CSFV positive. The total CSFV positive rate was 4%. The detection results of the 14 batches of C-Strain vaccines showed that all samples displayed bands of C-Strain amplicons in the SFR argarose gel electrophoresis and all vaccines were free of wild-type virus contamination. In conclusion, the RT-nestPCR assay established in the present study could supply a sensitive and specific test method for distinguishing wild-type CSFV infected animals from those vaccinated with C-strain vaccines in the field.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Off-target drift of chemical from agricultural spraying can damage sensitive crops, destroy beneficial insects, and intrude on human and domestic animal habitats, threatening environmental quality. Reduction of drift from aerial application can be facilitated at the edge of a field by offsetting spray ½ or 1 boom width from the field edge or by switching off one boom. For single boom application (and especially when spraying in a cross wind), there is some question whether off-target drift of sprayed crop protection agent is influenced by which boom is spraying and if direction of propeller rotation has any effect. An experiment was conducted to determine the effect of propeller wash rotation on aerial spray drift from turbine-powered aircraft. Spray samplers were placed at three sample lines to collect drift fallout and air-entrained particles 104, 134, 195, and 317 meters downwind, perpendicular to the flight path. An aqueous mixture of malathion was applied from the aircraft through fifty hollow cone nozzles. Five total replications were conducted over two days. Each replication had four treatment combinations of actively spraying boom and airplane direction. Results showed that neither active boom nor boom location (upwind or downwind) was statistically significant for either sampling method at the 0.05 level. Blocking the study to account for weather differences increased statistical precision. Thus when analysis was limited to the second day of testing, propeller wash direction was significant at the 0.10 level for the fallout sheets (P = 0.0773), and at the 0.05 level for high volume (Hi-Vol) air samplers (P = 0.0200). Higher concentrations occurred when propeller wash spiraled downwind. Based on results of this study, recommendations for pilots spraying with a single boom near a boundary is to spray so that propeller wash rotation occurs upwind.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;This study assessed the effects of dietary crude protein on performance and nitrogen economy of broilers. Chicks were allotted to 22, 20, 18 and 16% crude protein corn-soy diets in a completely randomized design for forty-two days. Several essential amino acids were observed to be deficient compared to recommendations for broiler chicks as the dietary crude protein level reduced. Feed intake, weight gain, feed to gain ratio, faecal nitrogen, nitrogen retention, anthropogenic potential and dressing percentage were influenced (P &amp;lt; 0.05) by the dietary treatments. However, mortality was not significantly different (P &amp;gt; 0.05). Feed intake, weight gain, nitrogen intake and output were significantly (P &amp;lt; 0.05) depressed as the CP level reduced. However, the best (P &amp;lt; 0.05) nitrogen retention and percentage faecal nitrogen was recorded for broilers fed 20% crude protein diet. Serum total protein, albumin, uric acid, creatinine and glucose were affected (P &amp;lt; 0.05) across treatments. It was concluded that there is a limit to which dietary crude protein of broilers could be reduced without any detrimental effects on the performance and nitrogen economy of the birds, even when the requirements for methionine and lysine has been met, as several other amino acids could be limiting. Consequently, to achieve significant improvement in nitrogen economy and reduction in amount of faecal nitrogen, 20% crude protein diets could be fed to broilers. However, there may be need to further manipulate the amino acid profile of the diet so as to improve its performance to be at par with higher crude protein diets.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

Forty-five of each explant type was cultured on the medium in triplicate experiments and results showed varied percentage survival and shooting for the various explants. Hypocotyl explants had the highest percentage of shooting explants at 13.3% for IbL; 6.67% for Ife and 20% in JM94/46. IbL cotyledon explants had 4.44% of shooting explants with no shoots recorded in Ife and JM94/46 cotyledon explants. IbL radicle explants had 2.22% shooting explants and no shoots recorded in Ife and JM94/46. Student Neuman Keuls (SNK) statistical analysis of cultivar-media interaction showed there was no significant difference (P &amp;gt; 0.05) among the three cultivars in number of calli and shooting calli. There was however significant difference among the cultivars in the number of shoots recorded.

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;This study was carried out in the Teaching and Research Farm of Delta State. University, Asaba campus (Nigeria) from March 2008 to June 2010 to evaluate the nutrient content (% dry matter) of maize as affected by different levels of organic manure and inorganic fertilizer. The experiment was carried out in a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) replicated three times in a factorial layout. Four different rates of poultry droppings, cattle dung and NPK 20: 10: 10 fertilizer were applied to three maize varieties sown at 75 cm x 15 cm spacing and the maize grains produced were evaluate for their nutrient content in percentage dry matter. The results obtained indicated that hybrid variety 9022-13 had the highest N, P and K contents (1.03, 1.68 and 0.26, respectively). Also, plants that received inorganic fertilizer had the highest values of 1.27% N, 1.64% P and 0.29% K. Based on rates of application, plants that received 450 kgha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; NPK 20: 10: 10 fertilizer had the highest values of 1.74% N, 1.71% P and 0.49% K. The interaction effects showed that only variety, manure type and rates % application were significant (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Based on this study, it is recommended that (i) Hybrid variety, 9022-13, which was outstanding in its nutrient content be grown in the study area.

								<abstract language="eng">The obvious advantage of the newspaper over other methods of disseminating agricultural technologies and information necessitated this exploratory study. The broad objective of the study was to investigate the extent of agricultural news coverage by the pointer newspaper in 2009. The specific objectives were to: ascertain the column inches (space) given to major categories of news by the pointer newspaper in 2009; examine the percentage column inches (space) given to each category of agricultural news by the pointer newspapers in 2009; and. determine the relationship between column inches (space) given to agricultural and other categories of news covered by the pointer newspaper in 2009. Secondary data were obtained from the pointer newspaper main office at Asaba in 2010 for the study. Eight (8) broad categories of news and seven (7) categories of agricultural news were assessed. The column inches for each category of news were measured for each month by use of a measuring tape. It was found that sports were allocated the highest number of column inches with percentage and mean values of 25.61% and 2010.35 respectively. This was followed by politics (21.43%; M= 1682.18), religion (11.49%, M= 901.77), foreign news (10.08%, M= 791.63), business (9.63%, M= 760.35), entertainment (9.26%, M= 727.07), education (8.86%, M= 695.47) and agriculture (3.59%, M= 282.03). Agriculture was the least category of news covered by the pointer news paper. Poultry news (26.43%) was the most frequently reported among the categories of agricultural news in 2009. This was followed by forestry and wild life (11.52%), commentaries (10.96%), fisheries (9.90%), and agronomy (7.17%). It was found that agriculture news were the least covered by the pointer newspaper in 2009 in spite of the importance of agriculture under the present civilian government. The Pointer newspaper should devote more spaces to agricultural news in order to enhance dissemination of agricultural information to farmers in the state.</abstract>

Multi-Stage sampling technique was used to source respondents for the study. Three out of the five local government areas (LGAs) were randomly selected in the study area. Five village communities were randomly selected from each of the five LGAs to give fifteen villages, while 10 farmers were also randomly selected from each village to give 150 respondents. Data collection was through an interview schedule. Simple descriptive statistics such as frequency counts, percentage and mean scores were used to achieve all the objectives of the study. Most of the respondents relied on radio as their major source of information on climate change. The perceived indicators of climate change by the respondents were excessive high temperatures, low and irregular rainfall pattern as well as low crop yields. Adaptation strategies used in the area included agroforestry practices, crop diversification, early maturing and disease/drought resistant varieties. The Major constraints to adaptation by the respondents were inadequate finance, poor infrastructures, unfavourable government/trade policies and poor technology. Extension agents in the study area should incorporate information on climate change in their extension messages.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Climate scenarios and projections have suggested that the impacts of climate change on land use will be noticed particularly by the communities that depend on natural resources for their subsistence. The climate vulnerability of poor communities varies greatly, but in general, climate change combines with other threats and becomes superimposed on existing vulnerabilities. This paper presents a case study that strives to understand the social organization in a vulnerable community of Guaraciaba, in southern Brazil, to investigate aspects of an adaptation strategy to climate change based on the local development and conservation of landraces of a set of crop species. Landraces are varieties better adapted to adversities, especially drought, which is an important threat to the famers in the region. Every farmer receives annually a “kit of biodiversity”, a set of local varieties with the amount of seeds necessary to be cultivated in order to produce enough food for the family. The study had a qualitative approach and was carried out through semi-structured interviews with technicians and 30% of the rural families who farm with landraces. The study concludes that the factors that make this adaptation strategy sustainable are: the ability to undertake actions strongly based on local socio-cultural needs (a social support network), biodiversity management practices designed to reduce external economic dependence, self management of genetic resources, the establishment of priorities based on locally available resources, a work plan for community participation (field days, a community based festival), the establishment of the roles of community in the planning and implementation of programs for biodiversity management.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Nutritional composition of a composite sample of whole green crabs, &lt;em&gt;Carcinus maenas &lt;/em&gt;(L.), was undertaken to evaluate efficacy as a forage fish replacement for seafood-meal manufacture. Whole green crabs sampled from New Hampshire waters were ground together and analyzed for proximate profile (moisture, lipid, protein, fiber, and ash), fatty acid profile, amino acid profile, mineral composition, and mercury content. Green crab mince contained 16.55 ± 0.29% ash, 12.27 ± 0.25% protein, and 0.21 ± 0.07% lipid, and comprised all amino acids essential for chickens and most species of fish. Fatty acid composition of ground green crab was 67.98% unsaturated, and 23.29% saturated, and was richer in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) than docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Levels of mercury in green crab mince were below testable limits. The nutritional profile of green crab mince was evaluated relative to the nutritional profile of menhaden from the literature, and possible agrifeed applications for whole green crab were considered. Green crab showed great potential as a forage fish replacer in seafood-meal applications for chickens and ash tolerant species of fish.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;This study was carried out in the Teaching and Research Farm of Delta State University, Asaba Campus (Nigeria) from March to December in 2008 and replicated between March and December, 2009, to evaluate the effects of variety and spacing on yield indices of Open-pollinated maize. It was a factorial experiment carried out in a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with four replicates. Four open-pollinated varieties (Suwan -1- SR, ACR97, BR9922-DMRSF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and AMATZBRC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;WB) were evaluated under three different plant spacing for such yield indices as number of cobs/plant, cob length, grain weight and number of grains/cob of maize. The results obtained indicated that variety BR9922-DMRSF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was outstanding with number of cobs/plant of 1.7 in both 2008 and 2009, cob length of 27.7 cm and 26.7 cm in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Its grain weight was 4.7 t/ha in 2008 and 4.9 t/ha in 2009, and its number of grain/cob was 467.7 in 2008, and 463.9 in 2009. Plants sown at spacing of 75 cm x 15cm had higher number of cobs/plant of 1.9 in both 2008 and 2009.Their grain weights (t/ha) were 5.0 in 2008 and 5.2 in 2009, their cob lengths were 18.6cm in 2008 and 20.1cm in 2009, while their number of grains/cob were 363.0 in 2008, and 369.0 in 2009. The results of interaction showed that except variety x space, the parameters investigated were all significantly (P &amp;lt; 0.05) different and affected yield indices of open-pollinated maize. Based on the findings of the study, it was recommended that (i) open-pollinated variety BR9922-DMRF&lt;sub&gt;2 &lt;/sub&gt;be grown in the study area for increased grain yield indices of maize. (ii) Plant spacing of 75 cm x 15 cm which resulted in higher number of cobs/plant and higher grain weight be adopted in maize production.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Adequate operation and maintenance (O&amp;amp;M) of irrigation infrastructure sustains irrigation scheme facilities, reduces repair costs, helps the system last longer, and keeps irrigation efficiency at design levels. In cases where farmers do not have sufficient capacity to operate and maintain the irrigation infrastructure sustainably, it is necessary for the farmers to enter into partnerships with external entities. The paper presents assessment of partnerships required for small-scale farmers at Rupike Irrigation scheme, in Masvingo, Zimbabwe, to operate and maintain their irrigation infrastructure sustainably. The O&amp;amp;M domain in the irrigation scheme consisted of five components of water acquisition (WA), water transmission (WT), water pumping (WP), water distribution (WD) and field water application (WAP). Group discussions of the farmers were held to obtain farmers’ input in the identification of components and activities for which partnerships were required. It was proposed that the scheme requires public-community partnership (P&lt;sub&gt;U&lt;/sub&gt;CP) to operate and maintain the dam, public-private-community partnership (P&lt;sub&gt;U&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;VT&lt;/sub&gt;CP) to operate and maintain the pump house, private-community partnership (P&lt;sub&gt;VT&lt;/sub&gt;CP) to operate and maintain the transmission and mainline and field distribution pipelines, and public-community partnership (P&lt;sub&gt;U&lt;/sub&gt;CP) to operate and maintain field application and crop production systems. It was also proposed that each partnership be formalised through contractual arrangements. It was recommended that the farmers improve funding for O&amp;amp;M through increased contributions as well as through partnerships with the private sector. It was also recommended that, for effective partnerships in irrigation schemes, it is important to analyse the scheme components and identify where and how such partnerships are needed for sustainable O&amp;amp;M of scheme infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">We investigate in this study (i) a redefinition of crop variety zonations at a spatial scale of 10x10 km, and (ii) the influence of recalibrated crop parameters on regional yield forecasting of winter wheat and grain maize in western Europe. The baseline zonation and initial crop parameter set was derived from the operational European crop growth monitoring system (CGMS) which involves the agrometeorological model WOFOST. Air temperature data from 325 weather stations over the 1992-2007 period were used to define new zonations in a 300 x 300 km test site. Two parameters which influenced mostly the phenological development stages (i.e. TSUM1 and TSUM2, the effective air temperature sums from emergence to anthesis, and from anthesis to maturity, respectively) were chosen and calibrated. The CGMS was finally run based on these new recalibrated parameters and simulated crop status indicators were compared with official statistics over the 2000-2007 period. Our results showed that the days of anthesis and maturity were simulated with coefficients of determination (R2) ranging from 0.22 to 0.87 for both crops over the study site. A qualitative assessment of maximum leaf area index and harvest index also revealed a more consistent spatial pattern than the initial zonation in the simulation results. Finally, recalibrated TSUM1 and TSUM2 led to improved relationships between official yield and simulated crop indicators (significant R2 in 17 out of 28 and in 14 out of 59 NUTS3 regions with respect to the best predictor for grain maize and winter wheat, respectively).</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Wheat (&lt;em&gt;Triticumaestivum&lt;/em&gt;) is one of the world's three major food crops, whose production is related to regional food security issues. Studies have shown that technological progress and climate change have a significant impact on wheat yield. We selected North China region as the study site because it is the main producer of wheat and because it experiences active climate change. Using the Agricultural Land Management Alternatives with Numerical Assessment Criteriamodel and statistical analysis method, the following factors were considered to determine the dominant factor that affects wheat production: temperature, precipitation, sunshine, and other climatic factors, mechanical power, irrigation area, chemical fertilizer amount, reservoir total storage capacity, and other technical factors.Results showed that wheat productionis affected by both climatic and non-climatic factors in North China region. Increased temperature has a positive impact on wheat production, whereas reduceds unshine has a negative effect. Warm and dry climate trends areconducive to wheat production. Mechanical tillage and fertilization, irrigation, and water conditions are conducive to the production of wheat, among which water condition has the most significant effect onwheat yield improvement. Compared withthe effects of climaticfactors, those of technical factors are more obvious and direct. In the premise of guaranteed technical conditions, the impactof climate changeonwheat production is more evidentindeveloped areas. Underdeveloped areas of wheat production are more dependent on technological progress; in particular, they rely on the use of chemical fertilizers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

However, potato productivity and industry expansion have been constrained by the poor quality seed tubers being produced in the informal seed sector due to inadequate supply of initial planting materials, improper fertilizer management practices and irregular rainfall patterns. A study was done at the Horticultural Research and Teaching Farm of Egerton University to determine the effect of integration of irrigation water, nitrogen and phosphorus rates on seed tuber relative weight loss and sprouting characteristics after storage. The three factors were tested in a split-split plot design where irrigation water supply was assigned to main plots, N to subplots and P to sub-subplots. The treatments were replicated three times and the trial repeated once. The treatments consisted of three irrigation water rates (40%, 65% and 100% field capacity), applied throughout the potato growth period through drip tube lines. Nitrogen was supplied as urea (46% N) at four equivalent rates of 0, 75, 112.5 and 150 kg N/ha, while phosphorus was supplied at planting time as triple superphosphate (46% P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) at four rates of 0, 115, 172.5 and 230 kg/ha P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, which translated into 0, 50.6, 75.9, 101.2 kg P/ha&lt;sub&gt;.&lt;/sub&gt; Data collected included relative percentage weight loss, number of sprouts and sprouting percentage. Data collected was subjected to analysis of variance and significantly different means separated using Tukey’s Studentized Range Test at p &lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt; 0.05. The 100% compared to 65% and 40% irrigation water rates resulted in relatively high weight loss, sprout length and reduced the number of sprouts and sprouting percentage of seed tubers. N and P rates generally decreased the relative weight loss, improved the number of sprouts and sprouting percentage. It is recommended to apply low to intermediate irrigation water, intermediate to high N and P rates to reduce the percentage relative weight loss and sprouting characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 style="line-height: 150%;"&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;The objective of this study was to measure the relative influence of the animal’s age, body condition score (BCS), glycemia at day of insemination (D&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) and the livestock management system on the probability of conception and occurrence of embryonic mortalities. In this study, 81 inseminated cows both of the Gobra Zebu breed and crossbred were sampled. Blood samples were collected the day of insemination (D&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) and twenty-one (D&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;) and thirty-five (D&lt;sub&gt;35&lt;/sub&gt;) days after AI. The BCS, the age and the livestock management system were recorded for all animals before the artificial insemination (AI). The glycemia was measured on D&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Pregnancy diagnosis was performed by progesterone and pregnancy associated glycoprotein assays and transrectal palpation. A multinomial logistic model was used to analyze the effect of the selection criteria for cows on the success rate of AI.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The pregnancy diagnosis makes possible to detect 47% of pregnant cows and 26% of late embryonic mortality (LEM) at D&lt;sub&gt;60 &lt;/sub&gt;post AI. The maximum likelihood test carried out on the model permits to reject the null hypothesis (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) according to which all animals have the same chance of being pregnant (47%). The variables thus provide a significant amount of information to explain the variability in the success rate of AI. The most significant factor was age (p &amp;lt; 0.0001), followed by the BCS, then glycemia and finally the livestock management system (p = 0.047). The BCS is the factor that most explains the variability in pregnant cows. For the group of LEM, age of the animal accounts for variability.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;The development of the agricultural sector and the improvement of the food security situation are seen as essential components to sustainable development in Sub-Sahara Africa. However, continuing population growth, impacts of climate change and environmental degradation add to an unprecedented combination of pressures that threaten existing efforts and solutions. This article discusses the relation between the challenges of making agriculture more sustainable and meeting food security needs. Several solutions proposals are discussed and organic farming as one of them is used to develop decision criteria. Due to its involvement of all three dimensions of sustainable development, economic, social and environmental organic farming could be one possible approach to create a more sustainable agricultural system.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">A pasture (45 ha) in northeastern Oregon was grazed with 30 yearlings (419 kg, Body Condition Score [BCS] = 5.05) and 30 mature cows with calves (499 kg, BCS = 4.65) during August of 2001 and 2002. Sampling dates were d 0, d 10, d 20, and d 30. Forage availability before grazing was 1,039.0 kg·ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and declined to 332.6 kg·ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; after grazing (&lt;em&gt;p &lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt; 0.10). Grasses dominated the pasture (44.5%), followed by forbs (30.7%), grasslikes (15.9%), and shrubs (8.9%). Due to grazing quackgrass (&lt;em&gt;Agropyron repens &lt;/em&gt;(L.) Beauv.), western fescue (&lt;em&gt;Festuca occidentalis &lt;/em&gt;Walt.), California brome (&lt;em&gt;Bromus carinatus &lt;/em&gt;Hook.), and redtop (&lt;em&gt;Agrostis alba &lt;/em&gt;L.) exhibited the greatest decline in quantity. Shrub utilization was high from d 20 to d 30 (49 to 58% for willow [&lt;em&gt;Salix rigida&lt;/em&gt; {Hook.} Cronq.]&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and 58 to 74 % for alder [&lt;em&gt;Alnus incana &lt;/em&gt;{L.} Moench.]). Forbs decreased (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.10) in moisture late in the grazing period, while shrubs were (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; 0.10) still succulent (63%). Forbs and shrubs were higher (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.10) than grasses in crude protein (11, 14, and 6%, respectively) and digestibility (59, 50, and 42%, respectively). In summary, our results suggest that cattle grazing late-summer riparian pastures will switch to intensive shrub utilization when grasses decline in quantity and quality, and forbs decline in quantity. Land managers need to know the effect of their management on vegetation and if a goal is to protect riparian woody vegetation, our data suggest that late-summer grazing should be light, or avoided when grasses have senesced.</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Use of saline lands for agroforestry relies primarily on plant species that have the trait of salinity tolerance, and also other economic and agronomic benefits. The selection of species, however, also needs to consider other key factors such as compatibility with existing flora, and potential for environmental benefits such as improved soil fertility or lowering of the water table in the case of dryland salinity. The testing of candidate species in particular environments needs substantial investments of costs and time. In this paper, a novel approach is presented for the rapid identification of potentially salt tolerant &lt;em&gt;Acacia &lt;/em&gt;species, based on molecular phylogenetic analysis. The approach has been applied to four species groups, &lt;em&gt;Acacia pendula, A. salicina, A. victoriae&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;A. stenophylla&lt;/em&gt;. The nuclear-encoded ribosomal DNA internal and external transcribed spacer (ITS and ETS) regions were used as markers, and phylogenetic analyses undertaken to identify closely related species that may share the salt tolerance traits. Such a methodology could be used to more rapidly identify candidate native species for agroforestry in salinity-affected regions and for preventing further expansion of salinity, thus assisting in biodiversity conservation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Several palm plants have social and economic roles worldwide by providing drinks from their sap. In Côte d’Ivoire, management of the coconut sap is not yet practiced. In this study, parameters related to production of sap have been assessed from four coconut cultivars namely PB 113&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and PB 121&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; hybrids and WAT and MYD varieties. From all the unopened inflorescences (spathes) studied into the coconut crown, whose ranks varied from 7 to 9, that of rank 8 yielded the highest volume of sap. From this spathe, the PB113&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; hybrid provided the best yield of sap (61.81 ± 20.41 l). Most important proportion of that sap volume was recorded at the morning harvesting. The sap production duration of a spathe varied from 24 ± 1.87 days (MYD) to 46.78 ± 1.86 days (PB 113&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). That duration depended on the length of spathes and regular sap flow allowed by them. Furthermore, the PB 113&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; had the highest number of fruits (NBF = 174.33 ± 78.45 fruits). The results showed that volume of sap available is closely related to the length of production (r = 0.78) and the cultivar’s nut yield (r = 0.82). The use of PB 113&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; hybrid which provided highest quantity of sap is recommended for promoting the production of coconut sap in Côte d’Ivoire in order to improve the benefits derived from this plant.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;With increasing population, coupled with land shortage and weather variations, wetlands in Uganda have continued to face degradation due to mainly conversion for agricultural, industrial and settlement purposes. The objective of this study was to determine the spatial and temporal wetland use/cover changes and local perceptions attributed to these changes. The study utilized three sets of ortho-rectified and cloud free Landsat TM/ETM+/MSS temporal images (30 m) of 1986, 2000 and 2011. The classification procedures were carried out using an Integrated Land and Water Information System (ILWIS) software version 3.7. A wetland classification system for Uganda developed by the National Biomass Study, 2003 was adopted to describe the wetland use/cover types. The classified images were validated in a ground truthing exercise using Global Positioning System (GPS) to improve on the classification accuracy. Key informant interviews and focus group discussions were conducted with communities adjacent to the wetlands in each of three of the ten Ugandan agro-ecological zones to determine the underlying drivers of wetland use/cover changes, while household interviews generated information on local perceptions of the changes. Significant changes were mainly observed in wetland use/cover between 1986 and 2011. Major factors responsible for these changes were subsistence farming due to intensification of growing paddy rice in Kyoga plains, an influx of migrants who accessed wetlands for daily subsistence (livestock grazing) in South western farmlands and proximity to urban centres in the Lake Victoria Crescent. In all the sampled agro-ecological zones, increased crop farming in wetlands was due to changing opportunities created by existent large markets for wetland crops. Majority (60%) of the local people perceived wetlands in their proximity to have undergone high degradation within the last 10 years, and to have declined in quantity and quality of vegetation, soil fertility and water levels. There was a noticeable variation across the sampled agro-ecological zones, with the highest proportion of local communities perceiving degradation being in Kyoga plains (76%), followed by Lake Victoria crescent (63%) and South-western farmlands (41%). Locally perceived threats to wetlands were mainly from crop growing that accounted for 33% of the frequency of mentioned threats, collection of wetland resources (30%), and prolonged floods and droughts (12%). This study confirms the importance of economic opportunities from new market outlets and migration in its various forms as key factors in land use change, especially at timescales of a couple of decades.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;This study analyzes the level and determinants of technical efficiency of soybean farms in the Saboba and Chereponi districts of northern Ghana. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to select 200 soybean farmers from which cross-sectional data was collected using a structured questionnaire. Data collected includes farmers’ socio-economic characteristics such as age and education as well as input and output quantities and prices. Data was analyzed using the stochastic frontier approach. Results showed a mean technical efficiency estimate of 53 percent and the return to scale was 0.75. Location of farm, participation in the Agricultural Value Chain Mentorship Project and age of farmer were found to be important in explaining technical inefficiency among soybean farmers. This implies that farmers in the short run can increase their production by 47 percent by adopting practices of the best soybean farms in Saboba and Chereponi districts of northern Ghana.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Although cocoa productivity has recently been increasing in Ghana, it is still low compared with that of other countries such as Cote d’Ivoire and Malaysia. This situation has been attributed to the low adoption of cocoa production technologies. The study was aimed at analysing the yield gap as well as some cocoa yield factors. Cross-sectional socio-economic survey was conducted in six (6) cocoa growing districts: Nkawie, Goaso, Enchi, Oda, Twifo Praso/Assin Fosu and Hohoe. A structured questionnaire was employed in the collection of data from 300 respondents who were randomly chosen with multi-stage cluster sampling technique. The yield gaps and their proportion to yield potentials were estimated using data from the survey and on-station trials. The findings indicated an experimental yield gap of 1 553.4 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, accounting for 82.1% of the experimental yield potential whereas farmer-based yield gap was 1 537.2 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, also accounting for 82.0% of the farmer (survey) yield potential. The Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression analysis indicated that frequency of spraying fungicides against black pod disease, spraying insecticides against capsids, weeding of cocoa farms, cocoa variety planted by farmer, area of cocoa farm and total cocoa production variables had a significant impact on cocoa yield. It is recommended that the Government should encourage cocoa farmers, through pragmatic measures, to adopt improved technologies for enhancing productivity instead of focusing on excessive land expansion which eventually leads to low productivity.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Genetic divergence of five mulberry accessions including Embu, Thika, Thailand (&lt;em&gt;M. alba&lt;/em&gt;), Kanva-2 and S41 (&lt;em&gt;M. indica&lt;/em&gt;) grown in Kenya were examined using twelve phenotypic traits. The assessment of phenotypic traits was done in a field study in two localities, Nairobi and Eldoret. The traits that were significantly different across the mulberry accessions included lamina width and petiole length (P ? 0.01), petiole width and growth height (P ? 0.05), internodes distance and number of branches (P ? 0.001). The Duncan’s Multiple Range Test (DMRT) results were used to generate a dendrogram derived from hierarchical cluster analysis that further partitioned the mulberry accessions into four groups. Embu and Thailand accessions grouped together while S41, Thika and Kanva-2 accessions grouped separately. Embu and Thailand accessions were characterized by fewer numbers of branches than the rest of the accessions. Thika accession had high number of branches and short internode distance. Significant and positive correlations were found between leaf yield traits except in internode distance and number of branches which were significant and negatively correlated. Significant and positive correlations can be utilized since they are rewarding for mulberry leaf yield improvement.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of cow age on botanical composition of diets in mountain riparian areas. Treatments consisted of 30 first-calf heifers, and 30 mature cows randomly assigned to four pastures (2 pastures/treatment, average 21.5 ha) in a 2-year study with a cross-over design. Botanical composition of diets was determined in fecal samples obtained from 10 animals in each treatment (5 per pasture) on the fourth week of 35 to 42-days grazing periods using the microhistological technique. Crude protein (CP) content and &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) were determined, and correction factors were calculated for 22 major plant species. In digested samples, grasses were overestimated, whereas, all forbs but northern bedstraw (&lt;em&gt;Galium boreale &lt;/em&gt;L.), were underestimated, and all shrub species were overestimated except common snowberry (&lt;em&gt;Symphoricarpos albus &lt;/em&gt;L.). Ponderosa pine (&lt;em&gt;Pinus ponderosa &lt;/em&gt;Dougl.) was highly overestimated after digestion. There was no difference between cattle age class in the total number of plant species found in the diets (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; 0.10) averaging in 41 species. Most individual grass and grasslike species made up more than 5% of the diets, while all individual forb, shrub, and tree species were minor components, not exceeding 5%, except ponderosa pine. Western wheatgrass (&lt;em&gt;Agropyron smithii &lt;/em&gt;Rybd.) and tufted hairgrass (&lt;em&gt;Deschampsia caespitosa &lt;/em&gt;(L.) Beauv.) accounted for over 10% of the diets. Heifers consumed more (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) grasses and fewer (&lt;em&gt;p &lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt; 0.10) shrubs and trees compared to mature cows. The diet of heifers contained more western wheatgrass, Baltic rush (&lt;em&gt;Juncus balticus &lt;/em&gt;Willd.), and pinegrass (&lt;em&gt;Calamagrostis rubescens &lt;/em&gt;Buckl.) (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.10), but less Kentucky bluegrass (&lt;em&gt;Poa pratensis &lt;/em&gt;L.) (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01), than the diet of mature cows. The proportion of ponderosa pine needles was higher in the diet of mature cows (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.10), than in the diet of first calf heifers. In summary, mature cows appeared to have selected a diet that contained less grasses and more shrubs and trees compared to younger cows.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;This study was carried out to determine the effects of age at prelay (15 and 19 weeks) and dietary supplementation of graded levels of Alphamune G (0.00, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06%) on laying performance of pullet chickens. The experiment period was 17 weeks and completely randomized design was employed. Feed intake, nutrient retention, weight gain and feed to gain ratio values were similar (p &amp;gt; 0.05) among birds fed the different dietary inclusion levels of Alphamune G. Hen day production, Haugh unit and Albumen height were significantly high (p &amp;lt; 0.05) for laying hens of fed the control diet. There was also interaction effect of Alphamune G and Age. The interaction of Alphamune G and Age gave the highest value in laying hens of group B fed the 0.05% diet when compared to the control. However, birds fed the 0.06% Alphamune G inclusion level gave the best result in terms of Production characteristics, Cost to benefit ratio expressed as Cost of feed to produce a Dozen Egg and Egg Quality. Also birds of group B gave better results than that of group A except in the Haugh unit value.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Northern Ghana is characterized by food insecurity largely due to over reliance on rain-fed agriculture under low farm input conditions. The present study investigated the effect of factors influencing mineral fertilizer adoption and use intensity among smallholder farmers in Northern Ghana. A total of 330 smallholder farmers selected through multi-stage sampling technique were interviewed. Adoption of fertilizer technology was determined by age, nativity, farm size, access to credit, and distance to agricultural office. The result of the truncated regression estimates indicated that income of household head, membership of farmer association, distance to agricultural office, access to input shop, income earning household that do not participate in agricultural development project and income earning male headed household were the significant factors influencing fertilizer use intensity. Distance to agricultural office was a key positive determinant of fertilizer adoption and use intensity. The study recommends improvement in road infrastructure and technical training of agricultural extension agents. Farmer based organization must be trained on regular basis to enhance their productive skills and technology uptake.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Prolonged drought and floods as a result of climate change are a serious problem for households at Mpolonjeni ADP because their livelihood is mainly rainfedfarming. This is evident as there is high level of food insecurity, crop failure, poverty and hunger, which has forced many households to abandon farming and survive by food aid. The study was a descriptive survey aimed to identify private adaptation strategies to climate change and conduct a cost benefit analysis for the identified adaptation strategies. A stratified random samplingtechnique was used to select 350 households. Personal interviews were conducted using structured questionnaires. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and cost benefit analysis where net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR) were used as decision rules. Adaptation strategies used were; drought resistant varieties, switching crops, irrigation, crop rotation, mulching, minimum tillage, early planting, late planting and intercropping. Switching crops had the highest NPV, where maize (E14.40) should be substituted with drought tolerant crops such as cotton (E1864.40), sorghum (E283.30) and dry beans (E292.20). The study recommends that households should grow drought tolerant crops such as cotton, sorghum and dry beans instead of maize. The government should provide irrigation infrastructure, such as dams, strengthen extension services and subsidise farm inputs in order to improve crop production.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Many standards constitute shea butter trading conditions, but the exploitation of this greasy product is submitted to other industrial exigencies. The aim of this study was to characterize and evaluate the utilization potentiality of the artisanal shea butter produced in Côte d’Ivoire, on the basis of the industrials exigencies. Hence, both beige and yellow artisanal (original and market) shea butters were collected and analyzed. The refractive indexes (1.46 ± 0.00) did not vary while specific gravity at 40 °C (0.86 ± 0.00 - 0.92 ± 0.00), unsaponifiable matter (1.80 ± 0.01 - 3.76 ± 0.02%) and pH values (5.39 - 6.69) showed significant differences from a sample to another. The viscosity was very high at 40 °C (86.78 ± 0.89 - 130.10 ± 0.26 mPas) and decreased with the temperature increasing (40 to 65 °C). The UV-Vis spectrum showed a very weak absorption from 300 to 400 nm (UV-B and UV-A domains) while the near infra-red (NIR) one, revealed peaks at 450 and 700 nm for yellow shea butters only and peaks at 1200, 1400, 1725 and 2150 nm for all the samples. The fatty acids profile highlighted four main fatty acids (palmitic, stearic, oleic and linoleic acids); saturated fatty acids (56.00 ± 0.20 - 63.00 ± 0.20%) were the most important. All these interesting characteristics should arouse attention for using traditional shea butters in food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Vegetables are among the major staple foods in Southern Nigeria. This study assessed the efficiency profiles of vegetable producers in Akwa Ibom State, Southern Nigeria with specific focus on farm level technical efficiency. One hundred and twenty (120) vegetable producers were randomly selected from three agricultural zones in the State. The Maximum Likelihood Estimates (MLEs) indicate positive relationships between input variables used by farmers and farm outputs. The Generalized Likelihood Ratio test confirms that vegetable producers in the area are relatively technically inefficient. The technical efficiency of the farmers ranged from 48 to 99 percent with a mean of 70 percent. The implication is that there is allowance to improve efficiency with available resource.There is, therefore, the need for policies to promote the availability of affordable farm inputs and technology to help improve farmers’ efficiency and increase vegetable production in the area. Extension services would also help provide useful information to the farmers on farm practices that would enhance output and ensure environmental sustainability of the production process by maintaining the quality of some critical environmental factors especially soil quality.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;The present study aimed to determine optimum values of the process factors to obtain a standard method of preparation with best quality of dockounou.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several samples of dockounou were prepared with different proportions (75 to 95%) of senescent plantain, cooking time, fermentation time and temperature of oven. Sensorial characteristics of the samples were investigated. Optimal values (scores) of both boiled and baked dockounou prepared with maize or rice flour were identified through tasters’ evaluation. Hence, the best scores were recorded with 90 and 85% of plantain paste proportion, respectively with maize and rice flours. Concerning cooking time, optimal values were registered at 60 minutes with maize-dockounou, and at 75 minutes with rice-dockounou flour. About fermentation time, the best sensorial characteristics were obtained at 4 hours for rice or maize-dockounou, but at 0 hours for the boiled rice one. Results revealed moreover that 160 °C would be the optimal baking temperature.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The optimized maize-dockounou would be better than the rice one on sensorial basis. Optimized maize-dockounou uses a larger quantity of plantain paste than optimized rice dockounou. This optimized dockounou uses shorter fermentation time than the traditional one. In general, the optimized dockounou is better than the traditional. It presents better characteristics and is more appreciated. Thus, optimized-dockounou is a real opportunity to convert rejected senescent plantains into foodstuff to help to feed the populations. That could be a way of food security.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;The study investigated the factors influencing the involvement of farm families in non farm income generating activities. Multi — stage and stratified simple random sampling procedures were used to compose the sample. The sample was made up of seventy two (72) heads of rural farm families. Data were collected by use of structured interview schedule and Focus Group Discussion. Data were analysed by simple percentage, Chi square test, multiple regression and correlation There was a significant relationship between number of non farm income generating activities and demographic characteristics (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.870). Farm size (t = -2.386; p = 0.020), level of education (t = -4.227; p = 0.00), and household size (t = 5.404; p = 0.00) were significant and constant predictors of number of non farm income generating activities engaged in by the farm families. A significant relationship was found between involvement in non farm income generating activities and soil degradation due to infertility (X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 23.66, p &amp;lt; 0.01) and oil spillage (X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 26.01, p &amp;lt; 0.01). The study established a linear relationship between number of income generating activities and demographic characteristics. Extension workers should take into cognisance all rural income generating activities engaged in by the farm families when embarking on services and programmes aimed at improving their welfare.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;The broad objective of the paper was to design a market oriented technology for agricultural and rural development in Africa. Marketing extension has been over looked in extension services delivery. Many of the agricultural technologies including the Top-Bottom, Feed-back, Farmer-Back to Farmer and Integrated Rural Development lacked in-built marketing components. The technology versus market component model was developed in this study. The model consists of the technical, market, and sustainability components as well as control mechanism. The theory of the technology and marketing component model states that, if the technical, marketing and sustainability components of a technology are properly designed implemented and controlled farmers will derive greater incentives from their investment. The marketing component should be specified in all agricultural technology after verifying the technical and sustainability components. Advisory services on marketing functions, role of cooperatives and organized markets in improving market incentives to the rural small and medium scale farmers were discussed. The model is recommended to research scientists and extension workers to adopt in a bid to improve the welfare of the rural farmers.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;The pod and yield characteristics of &lt;em&gt;Moringa oleifera &lt;/em&gt;plants grown in Ibadan (Rainforest vegetation), Nsukka (Forest-derived savannah vegetation) and Jos (arid derived savannah vegetation) were evaluated from 2007- 2009 to assess adaptability of the plant to climate change threats. The rainfall and temperature distribution in the three locations varied over the years. The &lt;em&gt;Moringa oleifera&lt;/em&gt; plants grown at Ibadan had the greatest pod and seed yield followed by those at Nsukka and Jos in that order. The annual pod and seed production capacities of the plants differed significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.05) in the different locations. The overall annual pod and seed production per location, including yield characteristics, did not differ significantly throughout the years of study. &lt;em&gt;Moringa oleifera&lt;/em&gt; was therefore found to be a suitable crop adaptable to various environmental and climatic changes in Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Carbon footprint (CF) is an increasingly important indicator of the impact of a product on climate change. This study followed international guidelines to quantify the CF of milk produced on 24 grazing-based dairy farms in southern Uruguay. Cows grazed all year-round and were supplemented with concentrate feeds. Dairy farms varied in annual milk yield per cow (5672 ± 1245 kg fat and protein corrected milk [FPCM]), milk production per ha (4075 ± 1360 kg FPCM/ha), cow stocking rate (0.71 ± 0.12 cows/ha), feed intake (13.3 ± 2.2 kg dry matter [DM]/cow/day) and percentage of concentrate in the diet (36 ± 12% DM) giving an average CF of 0.99 ± 0.10 kg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (equivalent [eq]/kg FPCM) over all farms. Total milk production per ha, milk yield per cow and dry matter intake explained most of the variation in CF. Strategies that provide the highest milk production per ha using high yielding cows and a high portion of lactating cows in the herd were identified as the best management practices for reducing CF. Low forage intake in Uruguay is often a consequence of low yielding pastures and high stocking rates. Overall, this study concluded that a reduction in CF is not achieved through increased concentrate intake unless forage consumption is also unconstrained. Improved pasture and feeding management can be used to reduce the CF of milk produced in Uruguay.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Tomato price is an important indicator for farmers to continue producing the crop in Ghana. There are sometimes alleged reports that farmers tend to commit suicide when they are unable to meet their expected tomato price and thereby unable to recover their cost of production. However, data available indicate that the domestic production of fresh tomato is on the decline. The paper therefore, assesses the factors that affect whether or not farmers can receive their expected tomato price. A multistaged sample survey of 215 farmers across three regions was subjected to the binomial probit model. Results indicate that for farmers to receive their expected price, they have to adapt to produce the crop in the drier seasons, where tomato shortage can be observed. Farmer education and experience are also important factors that are likely to help farmers receive their expected tomato price. The studytherefore recommends the promotion of strategies that are cost reducing especially in the dry season and also to improve access to critical production techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Adverse environmental conditions have contributed to perpetual poor cabbage (&lt;em&gt;Brassica oleraceae var. capitata&lt;/em&gt;) yields in sub-Saharan Africa. Elsewhere, net covers have been reported to provide a low-cost technology with the potential of modifying the microclimate around a crop for better performance. Two experiments were therefore conducted over a span of two seasons to determine the effects of agronet covers on microclimate modification and subsequent cabbage yield and quality. The treatments comprised cabbage plants grown under either fine mesh (0.4 mm pore diameter) or large mesh (0.9 mm pore diameter) agronet covers maintained permanently closed, or opened thrice weekly from 9 am to 3 pm and a control treatment where cabbage was grown in the open field. Net covering generally modified the microclimate by raising temperatures, relative humidity and volumetric water content but lowering photosynthetic active radiation and diurnal temperature range compared to control. The use of agronet covers resulted in better cabbage performance. The large mesh (0.9 mm) enhanced leaf stomatal conductance and chlorophyll content, and improved fresh and dry weight as well as head quality. Results of this study present the use of agronet covers as a potentially effective technology for use by small-scale farmers in protected cabbage culture in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

A study was conducted on the effect of watering regimes and water quantity on seedlings growth of &lt;em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;P. nitida&lt;/em&gt;. Seedlings were raised from seeds, transplanted in polythene bags and subjected to watering at full capacity daily, once in 3 days, 5 days; 20 ml daily, 3 days, 5 days; 15 ml daily, 3 days, 5 days; 10 ml daily, 3 days, 5 days; and flooding. The growth traits assessed were plant height, collar diameter, number of leaves; shoot, root and leaf dry weights as well as leaf area. The effect of watering regime and water quantity were significant (P ? 0.05) on quantitative morphological parameters of seedlings. Total dry weight and root dry weight were lower in both water-stressed and waterlogging than well-watered conditions, but the lowest values were obtained under flooding. However, specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf area ratio (LAR) were higher in water-stressed conditions than well-watered conditions. Relative growth rate of seedlings is related more to the net assimilation rate values than LAR and SLA. Also, root/shoot ratio was highest under daily full capacity watering. Thus, daily watering at full capacity with water availability or 15-20 ml of water per seedling during scarcity is recommended for raising &lt;em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;P. nitida&lt;/em&gt; seedlings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--[if gte mso 9]&gt;&lt;xml&gt; &lt;w:LatentStyles DefLockedState="false" DefUnhideWhenUsed="true"   DefSemiHidden="true" DefQFormat="false" DefPriority="99"   LatentStyleCount="267"&gt;

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Despite the large number of active programs breeding improved forage plants, relatively little is known about the weightings that breeders consciously or sub-consciously give to specific traits when selecting individual plants, or that agronomists and producers use when assessing the relative merits of contrasting cultivars. This is in contrast to most modern animal breeding programs where the relative merits of novel genetics may be assessed against an index-based breeding objective. There are numbers of reasons why these technologies have not been used widely in plant breeding although applications in forest tree breeding are relatively common. A first step in defining breeding objectives for forage species can be to define the relative importance of specific traits and to interpret how these contribute to the relative potential advantage to a new plant or cultivar. One method of defining these weightings is through surveys of users followed by analyses of their combined experience. Therefore in this study, we have assessed the usefulness of discrete choice techniques in the development of weightings for specific traits in forage plant improvement based on views of both expert users (agronomists and farm consultants) and farmers who were asked to define their relative priorities when considering the renovation of a pasture. The surveys were conducted in three distinct regions of, or environments within, Australia of special relevance to meat production from beef and sheep (high rainfall, temperate (inland), and Mediterranean). In summary this study defines the focus of breeding objectives and selection criteria for different pasture species across production systems.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;In Africa staple cereal foods are often eaten along with the African Leafy Vegetables (ALVs) rendering meals rich in micronutrients. To increase the mineral micronutrient value, it is imperative to intensify their cultivation given their under-utilized diversity, neglect until needed, slow rate of incorporation into crop value chains for lack clear micronutrient nutrition driven agenda. As a way of focusing on their ionomic nutraceutic attribute potential, the first objective was to investigate accession ionome differentials on the basis a soil mineral criterion.The second objective was to determine a method for variation assessment of ionomic micronutrient dense variants in key Kenyan local vegetables. Four ALVs species constituting 25 accessions were collected in short season rains of 2003 from north and souther stretch of western Kenyaand in early Long rains of 2004 from south eastern Kenya. A stratified sampling design organized had three collection points per farm; on three farms per site; and at three sites per phyto-region. ALV samples together with accompanying soils were Energy Dispersive X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysed. The data were used, first, for ionomically differentiating populations by way of singling out respective element influenced accession differentials (SELIACDs). Second, elements were jointly resolved into multi-element influenced accession differentials (MELIACDs). Agro-edaphic effects on population ionome niching were assessed using analysis of variance and graphical aids. Geometric means were generated and awarded nutrametric merit scores to allow for nutrametric grading of accessions. Results suggest a great deal of ionomic phenotypic plasticity among the local vegetable accessions as a function at scale of farm, site and/or region soils. The SELIACD method was useful for piecemeal separation of accession on a single element basis but which method would require the development of a selection index with a certainty of a significant genetic gain at the onset. The joint MELIACD and the nutrametric grading methods are proposed as a promising basis for prebreeding tool prioritization given the XRF-analytic novelty and the emerging interest in ALV nutraceutical cropping.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Cowpea, &lt;em&gt;Vigna unguiculata&lt;/em&gt; is widely cultivated in the tropics and subtropics as food for man and livestock. The crop is highly prone to pests and diseases which limit its production. Resistant cowpea varieties have become increasingly important in the management of both field and storage pests. Three improved cowpea varieties and one local variety were screened for their susceptibility to field and storage pests. The experiment was conducted in a randomized complete block design with four treatments and three replications. The different pests infesting the plants were identified and counted. Aphids and thrips were scored on a scale of 0-5, depending on the levels of infestations. Natural enemies’ numbers, leaf damage, pod damage and yield were assessed. &lt;em&gt;Callosobruchus maculatus&lt;/em&gt; infestations during storage and weight reduction were determined over a six week period. Aphids and &lt;em&gt;M. sjostedti&lt;/em&gt; score, &lt;em&gt;M. virtrata&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Empoasca&lt;/em&gt; sp. numbers did not differ significantly; however, significantly more pod sucking bubs attacked the local variety than the improved varieties. Natural enemies’ numbers on the various cultivars did not differ significantly. Yield was however significantly better in the improved varieties. The local variety suffered the largest weight reduction (20.91%) during storage while Nhyira suffered the least weight reduction of 4.23%. The use of improved varieties and application of pests’ control measures will increase cowpea production in Ghana.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Selection of salt spray tolerant plants with good physical appearance is of concern to ornamental growers in coastal communities. &lt;em&gt;Commelina erecta&lt;/em&gt; subsp. &lt;em&gt;maritima&lt;/em&gt; (C.V. Morton) C.V. Morton is a seashore plant that is widely distributed along the coast of West Africa. Therefore, the effect of salt spray was examined on the plant in a greenhouse experiment to determine its responses to various levels of air-borne salinity and to have an insight in the ecophysiological adaptations underlying these responses. It was also aimed to determine if varying levels of salt spray differentially damaged the plant. Filtered seawater was used to spray potted plants at: two sprays per week (2SS), four sprays per week (4SS) or six sprays per week (6SS) while in the control treatment (CSS), plants were sprayed with deionized water. Plants sprayed with seawater did not differ significantly (p &amp;gt; 0.05) in percentage necrotic leaf area compared to the control. All the plants survived but growth was inhibited by salt spray. Salt spray caused a significant (p &amp;lt; 0.05) reduction in leaf size and total chlorophyll content. Salt was accumulated in the shoot of salt-sprayed plants which led to ion toxicity. Salt sprays led to reduction in amount of essential nutrients in plant parts. &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;erecta &lt;/em&gt;subsp. &lt;em&gt;maritima&lt;/em&gt; adjusted osmotically to salt stress and increased stem succulence for ion dilution. The growth of the plant was negatively affected by salt sprays but it showed no significant necrotic damage, hence it is suitable for use as a landscaping plant in coastal beaches.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Evaluating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at farm level is an important tool to mitigate climate change. Livestock account for 80% of the total GHG emissions in Uruguay, and beef cow-calf systems are possibly the largest contributors. In cow-calf grazing systems, optimizing forage allowance and grazing intensity may increase pasture productivity, reproductive performance, beef productivity, and possibly reduce GHG emissions. This study estimated GHG emissions per kg of live weight gain (LWG) and per hectare from 20 cow-calf systems in Uruguay, with different management practices. The GHG emissions were on average 20.8 kg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-e.kg LWG&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, ranging from 11.4 to 32.2. Beef productivity and reproductive efficiency were the main determinants of GHG emissions. Five farm clusters were identified with different productive and environmental efficiency by numerical classification of relevant variables. Improving grazing efficiency by optimizing the stocking rate and forage production can increase beef productivity by 22% and reduce GHG emissions per kg LWG by 28% compared to “low performance” management. Further improvements in reproductive efficiency can increase productivity by 41% and reduce GHG emissions per kg LWG by 23%, resulting in a “carbon smart” strategy. However, the most intensified farms with highest stocking rate and beef productivity, did not reduce GHG emissions per kg LWG, while increased GHG emissions per ha compared to the carbon smart. This analysis showed that it is possible to simultaneously reduce carbon footprint per kg and per ha, by optimizing grazing management. This study demonstrated that there is high potential to reduce cow-calf GHG emissions through improved grazing management.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Potato is a valuable source for phytochemicals like vitamins, minerals, plant phenols, amino acids and proteins. However, environmental stress may affect the level of all these components. In this study, two purple breeding clones and one yellow fleshed cultivar (cv.) were assessed in their response to drought and wounding stress in two consecutive years. The plants were grown in the greenhouse under control (sufficient water supply) and with drought stress conditions. After harvest the tubers were analyzed for the content of soluble phenols and proteins in fresh tissue and after wounding. In addition, free amino acids (AAS) and activity of lipid acyl hydrolases (LAH) were assayed in control and drought stressed tubers. The results revealed significant differences in soluble phenols and proteins between genotypes, and that drought stress significantly increased the level of soluble proteins (P &amp;lt; 0.0001) and LAH activity (P &amp;lt; 0.001), but had no significant effect on the concentration of phenols. Moreover, total amounts of free AAS were higher in the drought stress variant. Wounding stress caused a significant increase of soluble phenols in cv. Agave. But, this was less prominent in purple clones which in general had higher contents of phenols. Proteins were also enhanced as a result of wounding, although, the effect of wounding stress on their level was smaller than that of drought stress.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;The present study attempted to highlight the concerns of shallow groundwater table depth (GWTD) to the sustainability of Wonji-Shoa Sugar Estate (WSSE), Upper Awash Valley of Ethiopia. The recent magnitude and fluctuation of GWTD is mapped in ArcView GIS (using universal kriging technique) from the monthly GWTD monitoring data (2007-2009) using piezometer tubes. The study result clearly showed that the GWTD at WSSE was extremely shallow, showed great spatio-seasonal variability and rising trend; thus, threatening the sustainability of WSSE significantly. About 90% of the plantation fields have GWTD above the critical depth of 1.5 m below the soil surface and, hence, critically waterlogged. As a result, the estate is recently achieving only 55% of the production potential realized in the 1960s. Past trends indicate that the GW has the potential to inundate Wonji plain and is anticipated to devastate production during the next 10-15 years. Therefore, in order to sustain production system in the region, there is an urgent need to identify the possible causes of waterlogging and investigate the feasible remedial measures to combat its problems. The spatial mapping of GWTD with identified problematic areas, indicated in the current study, is believed to provide a tool for water management and, hence, crucial for the decision making and actions taking processes.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Conservation agriculture has been promoted in Zambia as a strategy to mitigate some of the negative effects arising from conventional tillage practices. Conservation agriculture offers several potential benefits on soil properties. However, these benefits and impacts vary across agro ecological regions and management practices. This study investigated changes, over time, associated with the practice of conservation agriculture in selected soil chemical, physical and biological properties, including an assessment of the effects on soil respiration, nodulation and biological nitrogen fixation in soya beans (&lt;em&gt;Glycine max &lt;/em&gt;(L.) Merr). Six paired soil samples were collected from conservation agriculture and conventional tillage fields. Fields under conservation agriculture were 4, 7 and 16 years old while those under conventional tillage had been cultivated for over 18 years. Changes in soil properties due to conservation agriculture practice were determined using published laboratory procedures and compared using the paired t-test at 95% confidence level. The results indicated significantly higher soil pH, soil organic carbon, nodulation and biological nitrogen fixation under conservation agriculture than conventional tillage after seven years of practice. The study also showed significantly higher total porosity, soil microbial biomass, soil respiration and lower soil bulk density after sixteen years of practice. Based on these results, the practice of conservation agriculture has potential to improve crop productivity by improving the different aspects of soil fertility, the length of time before this is realized notwithstanding. Further studies that compare several conservation agriculture systems are recommended in other agro-ecological zones of the country to validate these findings.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Exudation of high amounts of citrate in white lupin (&lt;em&gt;Lupinus albus L. cv. Amiga&lt;/em&gt;) has the advantage of being effective in mobilization of a wide range of sparingly soluble P sources. To improve cultivation system of maize, a field experiment was conducted to assess effectiveness of white lupin (&lt;em&gt;Lupinus albus&lt;/em&gt; L. cv. Amiga) in increasing solubility of minjingu phosphate rock (MPR), phosphorus balances and maize yields in Njoro sub-County, Kenya. The randomized complete block design experiment was conducted for four seasons; short (October – February) and long rain seasons (March-September) of 2010 and 2011. The treatments were; (i) fallow (F) – maize (M) rotation with triple superphosphate (TSP) applied (M&lt;sub&gt;TSP&lt;/sub&gt;- F), (ii) fallow - maize rotation with MPR applied (M&lt;sub&gt;MPR&lt;/sub&gt; –F), (iii) lupin (L) – maize rotation with MPR applied (M&lt;sub&gt;MPR&lt;/sub&gt;- L) and (iv) maize/lupin intercrop with MPR applied (M/L&lt;sub&gt;MPR&lt;/sub&gt; – F). Soil and plant P and maize grain yield were higher in M/L&lt;sub&gt;MPR&lt;/sub&gt; – F (with additional lupin grain yield) and M&lt;sub&gt;TSP&lt;/sub&gt;– F treatments. All treatments resulted in positive P balances at the end of two years with highest values in M&lt;sub&gt;TSP&lt;/sub&gt;– F treatment and lowest in M/L&lt;sub&gt;MPR&lt;/sub&gt; – F. Intercropping lupin with maize amid application of MPR is recommended for enhanced maize performance in the farming systems of resource poor farmers. Measurement of available soil nitrogen and comparison of lupin with other legumes in solubilizing MPR is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) decomposition in fecal manure of cattle fed browses of Calliandra (&lt;em&gt;Calliandra calothyrsus&lt;/em&gt;), Gliricidia (&lt;em&gt;Gliricidia sepium&lt;/em&gt;) and Leucaena (&lt;em&gt;Leucaena leucocephala&lt;/em&gt;) browse/maize silage mixtures and maize (&lt;em&gt;Zea mays&lt;/em&gt;) silage alone when applied to the soil were investigated in a pot experiment in comparison to the corresponding silages fed. Maize silage alone had the lowest N and a larger C: N ratio, making it a poor quality compost when applied to the soil, but compared to the browse/maize silage mixtures it had the highest level of soluble N as non-protein nitrogen (NPN) which makes much of its N available for soil microbial decomposition of its organic C. Calliandra browse/maize silage mixture had the highest level of fiber-bound N (ADFN), which reduces N availability for soil microbial decomposition of its organic C in spite of its high N content and a narrower C: N ratio. Fecal manure from maize silage alone had a lower level of N and a wider C: N ratio than fecal manure from the other silages fed which would affect its decomposition in the soil, but it had the lowest level of ADFN and much of its N is made available for soil microbial decomposition of its organic C. Soil samples after 12 weeks of the experiment showed that Calliandra browse/maize silage mixture maintained the highest level of C in the soil, while maize silage alone maintained the lowest level. Also soils treated with fecal manure from the other browse/maize silage mixtures maintained higher levels of C than fecal manure from maize silage alone. Organic C levels were lowest at 8 weeks of the experiment for all treatments and rose to the original levels at 12 weeks which could have been as a result of biotic and hydrologic factors coupled with soil aggregation. Decomposition of organic N followed a similar trend as organic C. The two elements are linked in both plant inputs in the soil and in the eventual soil humic substances. The soils treated with browse/maize silage mixtures maintained C: N ratios that were similar to that of the control soil and higher than those of the fecal manure treatments. Thus, in spite of the added silage materials to the soil, rapid decomposition of organic C could not occur to reflect benefits of adding the silage materials to the soil. Thus, fecal manure, particularly from feeding animals on browse/forage diets is more beneficial in the soil as it would decompose more readily releasing the plant nutrients they contain.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Little is known about the health effects of heat in outdoor work and appropriate work and rest schedules for farmers working in developing countries. As temperatures continue to increase in tropical regions, such as Northern Ghana, it is necessary to evaluate how farmers experience and respond to high heat exposures. In this study, WBGT (Wet Bulb Globe Temperature) estimates and the ISO work / rest standards were applied to a cohort of farmers in the rural areas of Bawku East, Northern Ghana, to assess how farmers respond to high heat and how much they rest to protect their health, as well as the level of heat on their productivity. WBGT data was recorded over a period of 6 months among vegetable, cereals, and legume farmers. The ISO proposed and actual rest regimes observed by farmers in the same time period were evaluated. In the dry season the dry bulb temperature rose as high as 45 ºC, while during the humid months of March and April WBGT rose to levels as high as 34 ºC. Farmers worked for nine hours a day during these hot periods with insufficient rest, which has adverse consequences on their health and productivity.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Sheep production in Canada is a small industry in comparison to other livestock systems. Because of the potential for expansion of the sheep industry in Canada, the GHG emissions budget of this industry was assessed in this paper. The GHG emissions from Canadian lamb production were compared with those from the Canadian beef industry using the ULICEES model. The GHG emission intensity of the Canadian lamb industry was 21% higher than lamb production in France and Wales, and 27% higher than northern England. Enteric methane accounts for more than half of the GHG emissions from sheep in Canada. The protein based GHG emission intensity is 60% to 90% higher for sheep than for beef cattle in Canada. The GHG emission intensity for sheep in Eastern Canada is higher than for sheep in Western Canada. Protein based GHG emission intensity is more sensitive to the difference between sheep and beef than LW based emission intensity. This paper demonstrated that protein based GHG emission intensity is a more meaningful indicator for comparing different livestock species than live weight (LW) based GHG emission intensity.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;According to Bernard Stiegler’s theory of techno-evolution, technologies have an intrinsically pharmacological nature. They can be both supportive and destructive for sociotechnical practices based on them. Technological innovations always first disrupt existing sociotechnical practices, but can and should then always be appropriated by the social system to be turned into a new technical system upon which new sociotechnical practices are based. As constituted and conditioned by a technical system, agriculture is necessarily a system of care. Current deployment of transgenic technologies under capitalist conditions leads to processes of proletarianization in agriculture, which has led to their widespread rejection. However, they can and should become the basis of a new system of care, but only under the condition that they are wrought from corporate control and redeployed to initiate a process of deproletarianization&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p class="Style1"&gt;This study explored the acceptability of pearl millet grain in rural Eastern Kenya. Ninety seven households accepted to plant pearl millet. These were the 37 who were part of the study and other 60 who were not part of the study. When requested to barter 2 kg pearl millet with maize, 33 (85%) out of 39bartered with maize, 2 (5%) with sorghum, 2 (5%) with chicken and 2 (5%) with money. The average score for skill attainment was 88% with 92.5% mothers readily gaining the skill to prepare and incorporate pearl millet into the daily diet of children. Children liked pearl millet when given with a low of 77.8% and a high of 93.2%. These findings suggest that policies or programs to promote cultivation, bartering, and consumption of pearl millet grain could be well acceptable in rural Eastern Kenya which could add to the nutritional content of local diets.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;The study investigated the financial health status of small scale poultry businesses in Delta State, Nigeria using Altman’s Z-score model. The empirical study was undertaken to assess the solvency and hence future survivability of small scale poultry enterprises in the State. Financial data were extracted from three years (2010 – 2012) financial statements of 125 small scale poultry farms purposively selected from farms operating in the State and incorporated with the Nigerian Corporate Affairs Commission as limited liability agribusinesses. Descriptive statistics which include computed financial ratios, frequency distributions, percentages and tables were applied to analyze the content of the financial statements and Altman’s Z-scores’ were computed for each sampled farm for the three year period. The study shows that in 2010, 47.8 percent of farm enterprises had Z-scores between minus 0.60 to 1.55. In 2011 and 2012, 44.8 percent and 42.4 percent, respectively of the farms had Z-scores between negative 0.60 and 1.55. The study further indicates that 28 percent, 27 percent and 30.4 percent in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively, of the sampled farms had computed Z-scores between 2.64 and 4.79 farms. The study recommends the use of Altman’s Z-score by small scale investors as a technique for monitoring the financial health of their agribusinesses to prevent the ugly consequences of bankruptcy and liquidation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Food security remains a constant source of concern in Mali, where over 75% of the population derives their living from agriculture. Despite the huge theoretical need, the production and use of improved seeds remain very limited. Concurrently, genetic erosion and the disappearance of certain local varieties have been observed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The dual need to preserve agricultural biodiversity as a factor of resilience for production systems while disseminating improved varieties as a means to increase production raises questions regarding what type or types of organization could best respond to these agricultural challenges. The farmer seed network in Mali is based on the self-production of pearl millet and sorghum seeds and operates through non-commercial, community-based exchanges. The formal seed sector distributes certified seeds through cooperatives, with cost-effectiveness the main priority. The joining of these two seed networks could allow agro-biodiversity to be considered in such a way that genetic diversity can be maintained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The various pearl millet and sorghum seed exchange networks often are considered to be in opposition, with the formal network pitted against the informal one. By highlighting points where the two systems could come together, the proposed model allows a new perspective on seed flows and agro-biodiversity management. The global seed network that could emerge from this would, on one hand, remedy the failure of the state seed system inspired by a Western model in which seed production and distribution is disconnected from agricultural production, and, on the other, compensate for shortcomings in the traditional farmer seed system to increase productivity and sustainably manage farmer pearl millet and sorghum varieties while continuously introducing new genetic resources.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Knowledge on the interaction between plants and organic amendments is critical for the basic understanding of agroecosystems sustainability. Organic amendments are of great interest in agriculture by virtue of their ability to restore lost soil organic carbon in eroded or conventionally cultivated soils. The major objective of this study was to demonstrate and model the differential response of crop species to organic amendments. Despite the potential of such an interaction to improve crop production, it has never been formally demonstrated in a planned experiment. A two-year greenhouse experiment set as 3×3×5 factorial in a strip-split plot design was conducted. The effects of crop species, type of organic amendment, and application rates on grain yield of soybean, canola, and wheat were evaluated. To account for the asymmetry of the concave responses of soybean, mathematical transcendental models were fitted, for the first time, to yield data.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;The interaction between crop species and amended soils was highly significant. Soybean displayed concave transcendental yield responses whereas canola and wheat exhibited negative exponential responses, irrespective of the type of amendment. Turkey compost outperformed turkey litter and beef manure by 30% and 52%, respectively, with respect to soybean production; whereas turkey litter outperformed turkey compost and beef manure by 144% and 264%, respectively, with respect to canola and wheat production. It is concluded that in greenhouse settings and perhaps field conditions, growth and development of crop species can be enhanced by matching the specific characteristics of organic amendments to the specific nutrients demand of crop species.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Alternative sources of plant nutrients have now become highly imperative especially for vegetable crop production in Nigeria. Due to the escalating costs, environmental and health problems associated with excessive use of inorganic fertilizers on continuously cropped fields, there is a need for more research on the use of organic manures and residues. A field experiment was conducted in the late growing season from September to December, 2012 in Calabar, a humid forest agroecology in south eastern Nigeria to evaluate the effects of two types of goat manure (GM) application (single and double split doses), five rates of GM (0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) and 400kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1 &lt;/sup&gt;NPK fertilizer (120:60:60 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) rate on soil chemical properties and agronomic performance of sweet maize (&lt;em&gt;Zea mays&lt;/em&gt; L. saccharata Strut). Factorial combinations of the treatments were fitted into a randomized complete block design with three replications. The application of GM significantly (P ? 0.05) increased soil pH, organic matter (OM) content, total N, available P, exchangeable K, Ca, Mg and the cation exchange capacity (CEC) status of the soil. Soil exchangeable acidity (EA) was reduced from 1.76 to 0.64 cmol kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; at 20 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1 &lt;/sup&gt;GM rate. The 20 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1 &lt;/sup&gt;also recorded the highest values for soil pH, OM, P, Ca, Mg and CEC, while the values for residual N and K peaked at the NPK fertilizer treatment. The double split application of GM recorded higher values for growth and yield attributes, and increased soil properties than the single application. Growth and yield parameters such as plant height, number of leaves, leaf area index (LAI), total dry matter (TDM), number and weight of grains/ear and total grain yield were significantly (P &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; 0.05) increased by GM and NPK fertilizer treatments. The values obtained for all growth and yield parameters except LAI at the 20 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; GM rate were not significantly different from those at the NPK fertilizer treatments. The application of 5, 10, 15 and 20 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1 &lt;/sup&gt;GM, and NPK fertilizer significantly increased TDM by 11.9, 74.3, 91.9, 106.2 and 104.6%; weight of grains/ear by 16.5, 54.6, 61.4, 100.6 and 94.4% and total grain yield by 46.9, 111.7, 121.0, 127.2 and 140.1% respectively, compared with the control treatment. The interactions between number of applications and rates showed that split applying GM at 20 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1 &lt;/sup&gt;maximized TDM, weights of whole and dehusked green ears and total grain yield compared to other GM rates, hence it is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Climate analogue analysis is an approach that has been proposed in climate change impact studies to serve as a complement to climate impact projections. In this approach, a location whose present climate is similar to the projected climate of another location is investigated to learn about potential impacts of climate change, based on a real-life example. Possible response options to negative impacts may also be identified for climate change adaptation planning. The current study used the climatic distance method to determine analogue locations for Bugabira Commune in Burundi. The climatic distance was calculated from temperature and rainfall projections produced by three climate models, driven by two greenhouse gas emissions scenarios and assessed for three future time periods. Information relevant to farming systems and adaptation was then obtained through interviews that involved 450 household heads living in Bugabira (target) and Bubanza (analogue) communes in Burundi. By comparing the two farming systems using results from the analysis of the questionnaires, similarities and differences were determined. The analysis showed that crop and animal types, as well as various land management practices, were similar in both locations. Slight differences in land management strategies could only be noticed in the adoption rates of various technologies. Fifty-nine percent and 19% of farmers at the target and analogue locations, respectively, practiced contour ploughing, while 68% and 43% of farmers at the target and analogue locations practiced crop rotation. Eighty-seven percent of farmers at the target site and 58% of farmers in the analogue location applied manure to their farms. The differences in adoption rates could not be attributed to climatic or non-climatic factors. Based on the results, the study concluded that the analogues approach has low potential for the farmers of Bugabira to learn lessons for adaptation planning.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;In this work we have analyzed soil samples from Oxisols collected from two traditional communities, one formed by Guarany Indians at South of Brazil and other by African descendants on North of Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. The content and fractional composition of humus was investigated and the isolated humic acids (HAs) were characterized by elemental composition, &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, and high-performance size exclusion chromatography. The bioactivity of HAs was evaluated considering the effects on root growth of maize seedlings. Chemical properties from adjacent soils under native forest were used as control samples. The local field sites matching the traditional cropping requirements, were characterized by higher soil chemical fertility and soil organic matter hydrophobicity, as compared to the land plots considered as inadequate by rural peasants. The HAs from cropped soils revealed significant differences in respect to content, hydrophobicity, biostimulation and molecular dimension. Although all humic extracts promoted, both, root growth and the stimulation of lateral root emergence over control, the HAs from preferential local sites, revealed a larger bioactivity response on root stimulation even at lower concentration. The assessment of soil quality issued by local farmers, showed a valuable fitting with bio-chemical fertility indicators and SOM hydrophobicity.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;The use of inoculants is a critical strategy in legume production. In Zambia, inoculants are particularly used for the production of non-promiscuous genotypes of soya beans, but rarely for cowpeas and groundnuts. This study evaluated the response of soya beans, cowpeas and groundnuts to Biofix legume inoculants. Seeds were inoculated at the recommended or double the recommended rate at planting. Plants were grown under greenhouse conditions in a Completely Randomized Design for 7 weeks. Control, non-inoculated seeds were also planted and plants grown under the same conditions. At 7 weeks, nodule number and fresh weight per plant, nodule effectiveness (pinkness/redness), and above ground biomass were determined. Biologically fixed nitrogen was determined using the Nitrogen Difference Method. Nodule number and fresh weight per plant were higher at the recommended rate of Biofix application for soya beans and at both rates for groundnuts, while there was no effect on nodule fresh weight at either rate in cowpeas. All representative nodules assessed were effective. There was no significant benefit in inoculating seeds of the three legumes with Biofix on above ground biomass and biological nitrogen fixation. These results could suggest that possibly, the introduced strains though with a stronger nodulation competitiveness, were not as effective at fixing nitrogen as the indigenous strains in the soils in which soya beans, cowpeas and groundnuts have been repeatedly grown before. This could be an indication that sufficient and appropriate effective strains are already present in this soil. In general, the results suggest that to obtain the full benefits of biological nitrogen fixation, legume growers need to be provided with the correct inoculant, where required. Further work under field conditions is recommended to confirm these findings.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Fodder is continuously cultivated in coastal area of Salalah and Batinah region of Sultanate of Oman. However, this created a negative impact on the overall agriculture system and producti­on. The government authority stopped the cultivation of Rhodes grass in coastal area and support farmers with incentive systems in order to increase fodder production investment at Najed area. Due to irrigation water policy regulations, new technical solutions required, underground water availability, fodder investors have little data to help in making investment decisions. In addition, fodder production investments are characterized by much uncertainty due to the nature of the desert farming which is relying on many factors that cannot be controlled. In this paper a dynamic evaluation model was formed and developed as a method of analyzing the economic feasibility of fodder cultivation investment project with regard to project profitability under risk environment. Economic feasibility of the investment is evaluated through calculation of the Net Present Value and IRR by using Monte Carlo Simulation models. Our objective is to formulate a dynamic programming simulation model for the investment decision with incorporating this uncertainty in a probabilistic manner. Our simulation model result shows that the dynamic models are able to help investors and policy makers in taking optimum investment decision. Taking the risk into account leads to a significant decrease of the economic attractiveness of stakeholders and more Government support is needed to achieve water policy objectives and project sustainability at new developed area at Najed.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Carcass and organs characteristics of two breeds and sexes of poultry which include Duck and Guinea fowl (GF) were investigated. A total of twenty four matured birds with twelve from each breed were used for this study in a 2 × 2 (Breed × Sex) factorial arrangement in a completely randomized design. The birds were slaughtered in batches of four properly bled, defeathered and dressed, the carcasses and organs weighed. The birds carcasses were chilled at 4 ºC for 24hrs prior to fabrication into primal cuts. The results showed that duck had higher (P&amp;lt;0.05) carcass and organs weight and percentages than GF, also males irrespective of the breed gave higher (P&amp;lt;0.05) carcass and organs weight and percentages than their female counterparts. At interaction level male ducks still gave higher (P&amp;lt;0.05) cut-up parts weight and percentages than female, while female GF elicited higher (P&amp;lt;0.05) primal cuts weight and percentages. It was observed from this study that Duck and GF carcass and organs cut-up parts were heavy enough to supply needed protein like chicken. These birds can therefore, be integrated into commercial poultry production to make animal protein more available to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">The continuous cultivation of the Rhodes Grass in Batinah costal area and Salalah region of Sultanate of Oman has a negative impact on the overall agriculture system and production. Improvement of the conditions could be achieved by introducing new water policy into farming and using Government suppor­ting tools to motivate farmers and achieve financial sustainability. The new water policy and strategies formed by Government are examined in three cultivated locations in this paper: Salalah location with enough irrigation water, Hanfeet location with low irrigation water and Dawkah location with very low irrigation water. Economic efficiency of the location is evaluated through the Net Present Value and IRR calculation. Within the assumption of the objective evaluation of input parameters, we can expect an acceptable economic efficiency of the investment only in Salalah location. The simplified deterministic evaluation of economic efficiency is formed to identify the relevant risk factors, followed by its quantification by the simulation processes. Taking the risk into account leads to a significant decrease of the economic attractiveness of stakeholders and more Government support is needed to achieve water policy and project sustainability at new location at Hanfeet and Dawkah location.</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;This study was conducted to determine the effect of giving water contaminated with used engine oil on performance, carcass and meat characteristics of West African Dwarf (WAD) rams. 15 WAD rams about 10 months old were used. They were grouped into 5 balanced for weight. Used engine oil was collected from an Auto mechanic workshop in Ayetoro Yewa Ogun state and mixed to 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20ml with one litre of clean water at 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0% designated T0, T1, T2, T3 and T4 respectively. The rams were assigned to these treatment groups in a completely randomized design experiment and were given the contaminated water for 13 weeks. Data collected were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) at p=0.05. The results showed that nutrient intake was higher, while water intake decreased (p&amp;lt;0.05) as the level of used engine oil in water increased, nitrogen intakes and urinary nitrogen decreased (p&amp;lt;0.05) as well as nitrogen retention. Although weight gain increased (p&amp;lt;0.05) feed efficiency decreased (p&amp;lt;0.05). Carcass primal cuts and meat characteristics decreased except cooking yield and water holding capacity as used engine oil increased in the given water. It was therefore, recommended that used engine oil should not be allowed to flow freely into the surrounding water bodies where grazing animals may consume it as this may lead to reduction in their water intake which can affect the health of the animals and increased feed intake can affect profit margin of the farmers.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;em&gt;Pistia stratiotes&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lyngbya wollei&lt;/em&gt; are the two most common aquatic weeds that flourish in farm canals within the Everglades Agricultural Area of Florida. Identifying a useful application of these weeds would not only address important environmental concerns, but would also be an incentive for farmers to harvest it. The objective of this study was to determine use of &lt;em&gt;P. stratiotes&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;L. wollei&lt;/em&gt; as soil amendments for stimulation of seed germination and root growth in different plant species. The effects of different rates of dried and grounded &lt;em&gt;P. stratiotes&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;L. wollei&lt;/em&gt; on germination and root length of snap bean, corn, sorghum, common lambsquarters, and rice were evaluated using a controlled petri-dish incubation bioassay study. Overall, both amendments had a negative allelopathic effect on germination of all species. The highest reduction in germination of 80 and 43% by &lt;em&gt;P. stratiotes&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;L. wollei&lt;/em&gt; respectively&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;was observed on corn. Rice was the most tolerant to allelopathic effects that emanated from both amendments. There was a significant positive increase in rice root length in response to &lt;em&gt;P. stratiotes&lt;/em&gt; rate over the two-week period. This study shows that &lt;em&gt;P. stratiotes&lt;/em&gt; can be used as a potential bio-fertilizer to stimulate early growth of rice.</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Repeated application of animal manure to agricultural fields as a source of plant nutrients has led to questions concerning the impact of this practice on soil organic carbon (C) and biochemical properties, specifically the activity of soil enzymes. There are also some environmental concerns of using livestock manure. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of repeated applications of liquid swine manure (LSM) on total organic C (TOC), light fraction organic C (LFOC) and on the activity of the soil enzymes (arylsulfatase, alkaline phosphatase and urease) in two contrasting soil-climatic zones and cropping systems in Saskatchewan. Liquid hog manure was applied annually at 37,000 L ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and 74,000 L ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;rates for three years at Melfort (Mollic Cryoboralf) and for four years at Plenty (Typic Boroll) in Saskatchewan, Canada. Soil samples were collected to a depth of 0-15 cm in the spring of 2003 and analyzed for TOC, LFOC and enzyme activities. Annual application (37,000 L ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) and larger application made every two years (74,000 L ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) of LSM at Melfort increased LFOC, which was attributed to stimulation of plant growth and thus residue inputs, from the nutrients contained within the manure. Applications of LSM at 37,000 L ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and 74,000 L ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; at the Plenty site increased both TOC and LFOC concentration when compared to the control. Soil at the Plenty site is a Typic Boroll of heavy clay texture, which aids in protecting soil organic matter (SOM) from decomposition by soil microorganisms. Melfort was the only site that responded to LSM applications in terms of increased enzyme activity, which may be a result of a shorter application history. The Melfort site also had significantly higher LFOC in the manure treatments compared to the other site and LFOC has been linked to enzyme activity. The results of this study indicate that it may take a long period of time for addition of LSM to produce measurable changes in TOC and LFOC, as the effect from LSM is mainly from the stimulation of plant growth rather than from direct additions of C, and the nutrients contained in the LSM may potentially enhance microbial decomposition. In soils that receive repeated applications of LSM, nutrient loading may contribute to reduced enzyme activity after a period of time.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;On-farm trial was conducted from 2005 to 2008 to test the hypothesis that reduction of total dry matter (TDM) in crops can occur after a decreased radiation use efficiency (RUE) due to shortage of nitrogen and irrigation, we applied three irrigations treatments (D1, D2 and D3) and four nitrogen rates (N1, N2, N3 and N4). Photosynthetic active radiation absorbed or cumulative light interception (PARabs) and RUE of Durum wheat were measured. Results showed that D1N1 treatment recorded the highest LAI, PARabs, TDM and RUE. The maximum LAI was obtained 140 DAS (days after sowing) under treatment D1N2 (6.42) and the lowest LAI at the same phase belonged to treatment D2N4 (3.86). At the harvest, the maximum of TDM was 1487 g m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; recorded under treatment D1N1. The minimum value obtained was 930 g m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; under treatment D3N4. Also, PARabs was improved under D1N1 and D1N2 treatments. With reduced N application rates and irrigation doses, PARabs was decreased and the lowest values were observed under D3N4 condition. The RUE, varied from 1.55 g MJ&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (D1N1) to 1.24 g MJ&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (D3N4), was affected and decreased under deficit irrigation and low nitrogen conditions. In conclusion, the results of this study seem to show that D1N1 and D1N2 treatments can be beneficial for Durum wheat under field conditions in semi arid zone of Tunisia, for the purpose of improving RUE and maximizing grain yield.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;The developments of forest conservation Wildlife (SM) in Bentayan as flora and fauna ecology has created a conflict within the society and has negatively affected the wellbeing of the community in the area. The communities have used a lot of natural resources for their life. A development of Bentayan’s Wildlife Centre has been opposed by the community as the usage of various natural resources have been restricted after the development of the wildlife centre started. In order to solve the conflicts, many strategies have been employed. However, the expected outcome has not yet been achieved. Therefore, the current study provides a conflict resolution model approach to accommodate the interests of all parties, both society and government through the Natural Resources Conservation Center. The model was developed from narrative data that was collected through series of dialogues and negotiation process with both parties (community and agency/Centre) involving stakeholders and community members. This proposed model can be used as a framework for managing forestry and wildlife centre.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Insufficient supply of P for initial growth of crops does not only limit N uptake but it also leads to poor yield of crops. In acidic soils of the tropics, sorption of P occurs mainly on surfaces of Fe and Al oxides and hydroxides. Most of the P added through mineral fertilizers is fixed by high Al and Fe oxide concentrations and transformed into insoluble P compounds. Reduction of Al and Fe is important so as to ensure adequate supply and readily available P for crops uptake. A number of studies using zeolites as an amendment in the fertilization programs of crops have improved crops production, nutrients uptake, and nutrients use efficiency. However, there is dearth of information on the use of clinoptilolite zeolite (CZ) to reduce P fixation not to mention reduction of N, P, and K fertilizers use in agriculture. This study was conducted to: (i) determine dry matter production, nutrients concentration, nutrients uptake, and use efficiency of &lt;em&gt;Zea mays&lt;/em&gt; (Hibrimas variety) by including CZ in the fertilization program of &lt;em&gt;Zea mays&lt;/em&gt; planted on an acidic soil, and (ii) determine the effect of including CZ in the fertilization program of &lt;em&gt;Zea mays&lt;/em&gt; on selected chemical properties of an acidic soil. Egypt rock phosphate (ERP), urea, and muriate of potash were used in this study. Seventy five percent (w/w) of the recommended N, P, and K fertilizers for &lt;em&gt;Zea mays&lt;/em&gt; were combined with CZ. Standard procedures were used to determine soil pH, inorganic nitrogen, available phosphorus, exchangeable aluminium, iron, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and organic matter before and after planting. &lt;em&gt;Zea mays&lt;/em&gt; were harvested at tasselling stage and measured for dry matter production, nutrients uptake and use efficiency. The effect of CZ application with 75% of fertilizers (E2) and 100% fertilizers (E1) were statistically similar for selected soil chemical properties, dry matter production, nutrients concentration, uptake of nutrients, and nutrients use efficiency except for N. Nitrogen use efficiency for E2 was better than that of E1. These findings suggest that adoption of CZ with 25% reduction of N, P, and K fertilizers are useful. Further field trials and economic analysis are recommended to confirm the findings of this study. These aspects are being investigated in our on-going field experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Agriculture in the Central African sub-region is still to fulfill its promise of creating decent employment and welfare. Climate change threatens to exacerbate this challenge. This paper specifies a model for sustainable comprehensive agricultural development in the Congo Basin and identifies options for improving livelihoods and achieving food security while addressing the global concerns of carbon sequestration and preserving biodiversity. It is suggested that the capacity of local and regional institutions be enhanced to communicate the model recommendations as part of a broad agenda in agricultural planning and decision making processes which address biodiversity management, climate change adaptation and national development priorities.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;The farmers’ knowledge of the cultivars to use in increasing sweetpotato productivity is critically important. A study was carried out in the Teso Sub-region to investigate the role of education in sweet potato production. Using an ex post facto design, 24 out of 51 sub-counties were purposively selected applying district-county strata and used to determine the perceptions of sweetpotato farmers and of their agricultural advisers. Through interviews, observations and questionnaires, the survey covered 288 farmers randomly selected and a whole population of 33 agricultural advisers, while 329 community leaders purposively selected and farmers randomly selected were engaged in focus group discussions. A total of 650 persons participated. Data were collected on farmers’ knowledge of sweetpotato cultivars grown capturing selected attributes. Analysis of data was done qualitatively using open and axial coding and quantitatively using means, frequencies, percentages, ANOVA and multiple regressions at a confidence level of 0.05 (?). Using selected attributes, farmers identified 139 cultivars grown. The best performing cultivar was &lt;em&gt;Araka &lt;/em&gt;yielding a range of 19,001-29,000 kg/ha but was susceptible to the sweetpotato weevil and drought. &lt;em&gt;Araka &lt;/em&gt;also stores poorly as dried chips or sliced. The least performing cultivars were &lt;em&gt;Elany ikokolak, Epaku &amp;amp; Ocaka amani &lt;/em&gt;with yields below 5,000 kg/ha but less susceptible. Commercialising the crop with value addition, farmers need up-scaling of their scientific knowledge of cultivars and production as basis for better multiplification &amp;amp; selection of vines for higher yields needed in processing the crop for its several uses.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;The study evaluated staking options to address the problem of deforestation for sustainable yam production in the Forest and Forest-Savannah Transition zones of Ghana. A split-plot design with three yam varieties (Dente, Water Yam and TDR95/19177 line) and three staking options (No staking, Vertical staking and Trellis with 50% and 30% number of vertical stakes for 2012 and 2013 respectively) as main plots and subplots respectively were used. Results revealed a significant (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; 0.05) interaction between yam variety and staking options on yam tuber yields in both locations and years. While water yam had similar tuber yields under all staking options, Dente and TDR95/19177 under no staking had significant yield reductions ranging from 37 to 65% compared to the other staking options. The observed yield reduction under no staking of Dente and TDR95/19177 could be attributed to higher incidence of yam mosaic virus leading to significantly lower fresh leaf biomass production. Reducing the number of stakes in trellis to as low as 30% of the vertical/optimum staking option did not result in a significant reduction in tuber yields for TDR95/19177 and Water yam. The economic analysis revealed that it is more profitable to produce water yam and TDR95/19177 under no staking and trellis (50% and 30% number of optimum staking) respectively in both locations. The results suggest trellis/minimum staking can be used to minimize the use of stakes, yam mosaic virus disease infection and for sustainable yam production in the face of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;The application of the principles of thermodynamics and General Systems Theory is responsible for important progress in the study of soil and its fertility, and this application can even improve our understanding of the processes that govern the functioning of soil and determine the magnitude of soil fertility. Consequently, we can improve the evaluation and practices recommended for preserving or improving the soil and its fertility, contributing to sustainable food production. Recalling how the concept and &lt;em&gt;human &lt;/em&gt;perception of soil have evolved is fundamental to improve our understanding. Thus, this article aims to encourage people to reflect on the application of the principles of thermodynamics of non-equilibrium and General Systems Theory in studying the soil and its fertility and to participate in constructing a new notion of soil fertility, able to express what is perceived by plants. Several authors in the last century have considered the soil to be an open system; however, this approach is a recent in Brazil. Fertility can be coherently understood as one of the emergent properties of the soil system by applying the principles of thermodynamics of non-equilibrium and General Systems Theory to the study of soil.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Access to credit is regarded as an important intervention for improving the incomes of the rural population, mainly by mobilizing resources to more productive uses. Production of vegetables by smallholder farmers in Swaziland is inconsistent and lower than the national demand, hence the gap is filled by imports from South Africa. The purpose of the study was to assess the influence of credit on technical efficiency of smallholder vegetable farmers in Swaziland. Data were collected in 2013 from farmers through a structured questionnaire, which was administered using personal interviews. A two-stage sampling procedure was used by stratifying the vegetable farmers in the Hhohho region according to the four Rural Development Areas (RDAs). This was followed by a simple random sampling technique used to select the number of vegetable farmers from each stratum. A sample size of 120 farmers was selected from a population of 289. The Stochastic Frontier production function was used to analyze the data using the STATA program (version 12). The results revealed that credit had a negative effect on technical efficiency of cabbage and green pepper farmers, while it had a positive effect on the technical efficiency of tomato, and beetroot farmers. The technical efficiency of tomatoes and cabbage farmers was affected by age, education level, farming experience and access to credit (p &amp;lt;0.01), while beetroot and green pepper was affected by farmer’s age, and off-farm income. (p&amp;lt;0.05). The study recommended that vegetable farmers should increase the amount of seeds, fertilizer and chemicals used in order to improve yields. The Government of Swaziland should subsidize farming inputs and financial institutions should make credit more available to agribusinesses in order to improve the efficient use of input resources.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Yield gap survey (YGS) was carried out in nine selected communities in the Sudanno-Guinea Savannah (SGS) rice growing ecologies of Ghana in the 2012 and 2013 cropping seasons. One lead farmer was selected from each community to host researcher-managed fields. The specific objectives of the study were to determine the causes of yield gaps in rain fed and irrigated ecologies of the SGS of Ghana and to suggest ways by which the gaps can be bridged to enhance the production of the crop in Ghana&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In both 2012 and 2013 seasons, farmers in the Sudan savannah zone recorded higher gaps in rice yields (average 55%) than their compatriots in the Guinea Savannah (average 49%). The analysis of data collected from YGS indicated that factors such as difficult weather and soil conditions, insufficient access to mechanization services/improper land preparation, lack of fertilizers, the use of unimproved rice seed, untimely field operations and inadequate water and pest (in particular weed) management, were some of the key factors that adversely influence rice yields in the study area&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unrestricted access to mechanization services delivery, intensified use of improved rice seed, appropriate melioration with organic and inorganic fertilizers, together with robust soil and water management interventions are essential requirements for bridging experiment-based yield gaps for enhanced rice yields in the Sudanno-Guinea Savannah zones of Ghana.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

Among the treatments, the minimum disease severity was recorded in the T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; treatment where treatment was given as seed treatment with &lt;em&gt;T. harzianum&lt;/em&gt; + soil application of neem cake powder + foliar spray of carbendazim, representing the value 4.82, 8.23, 12.37 and 16.37 per cent against 10.75, 14.84, 20.00 and 25.75 per cent in case of control at 30, 45, 60 and 75 days age of plant, respectively. Integrated approach has also been able to increase shoot length as 27.00, 42.15, 54.98, and 65.07 cm at 30, 45, 60 and 75 days age of plant, respectively whereas in case of control it was 18.60, 25.70, 34.63 and 44.29. Similarly, fresh and dry shoot and root weight have also been found increased in case of integrated approaches. Biochemical analysis of the treated plants revealed that highest soluble protein and total phenol content is observed in T3 treatment (Seed treatment with &lt;em&gt;T. harzianum&lt;/em&gt; + soil treatment with neem cake powder and foliar spray with carbendazim), showing 37.85, 36.78 and 35.76 mg/gm of fresh leave of protein and 2.40, 2.14 and 2.04 mg/gm of fresh leave of phenol at 30, 45 and 60 days age of plant.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;As per yield is concerned, it has found that the maximum yield was obtained per plant from the treatment given as seed treatment with&lt;em&gt; T. harzianum &lt;/em&gt;+ soil treatment with neem cake powder + foliar spray with carbendazim, showing the value of 500 g per plant which was followed by the&lt;sub&gt; &lt;/sub&gt;treatment given as seed treatment with&lt;em&gt; T. harzianum &lt;/em&gt;+ soil treatment with neem cake powder + foliar spray with neem leaf extract showing 470 g per plant.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;The threats to sustainable agriculture caused by severe land degradation, high soil salinity, and increased production costs on salt-affected, irrigated croplands of Uzbekistan, Central Asia, are both challenging and urgent. The present wide-spread cultivation practices of wheat (&lt;em&gt;Triticum aestivum&lt;/em&gt; L.) and maize (&lt;em&gt;Zea mays&lt;/em&gt; L.), but in particular cotton (&lt;em&gt;Gossypium hirsutum&lt;/em&gt; L.), which was the predominant crop during the Soviet Union period (1924-1991) need to be altered by considering improved, technically feasible and economically viable practices. Therefore, the economic performance of three innovative crop rotation systems have been assessed and compared to Conventional Tillage (CT) practices. The cropping systems were all exposed to Bed Planting (BP) with a crop residue cover and included cotton-cover crop-cotton, cotton-wheat, and cotton-wheat-maize. Risk assessment was based on commodity prices and included State Procurement Price (SPP) and free Market Price (MP), but also variable production and input costs. A linear mathematic optimization model was employed to generate various simulations. Financial benefits (expressed in US dollars) were based on 2009 input costs and product prices. The findings revealed that Conservation Agriculture (CA)-based practices applied to the cropping systems could substantially increase economic returns especially in the early stages of adaption, provided they are flanked with appropriate agricultural practices and careful farm managements.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;High cost of inorganic fertilizers and lime has precluded their use by smallholder farmers to remedy the problem of soil acidity and infertility in Kenya. To address the problem, we tested a precision technique referred to as micro-dosing, which involves application of small, affordable quantities of inorganic inputs on an acid soil in Busia County, Kenya. Experimental treatments were N-fertilizer (0 and 37.5 kg N ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), P-fertilizer (0 and 13 kg P ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) and lime (0, 0.77 and 1.55 tons lime ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). 37.5 kg N and 13 kg P ha&lt;sup&gt;-1 &lt;/sup&gt;are 50% of the recommended fertilizer rates for maize production in Kenya while 0.77 and 1.55 tons lime ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; are 25 and 50% of the actual requirement. Soil chemical changes, maize grain yield and nutrient recovery were determined. Lime and P-fertilizer significantly affected only the top-soil pH, Ca, Mg and available P, while the effects of N-fertilizer were evident on both top- and sub-soil N likely due to its faster mobility than P and lime. Grain P-fertilizer recovery efficiencies were 14 and 16-27% due to 13 kg P and 13 kg P + 0.77-1.55 tons lime ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. N-fertilizer recovery efficiencies were 37 and 42-45% due to 37.5 kg N and 37.5 kg N + 0.77-1.55 tons lime ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Fertilizers applied to supply 37.5 kg N, 13 kg P and 0.77-1.55 tons lime ha&lt;sup&gt;-1 &lt;/sup&gt;increased grain yield above the control by 134, 39 and 12-22%, respectively, therefore micro-dosing of these inputs can increase maize production on Kenyan acid soils.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;Minimum tillage and other conservation agriculture practices are not only associated with income gains but are also claimed to be the panacea to the declining agricultural productivity and soil degradation problems in Africa and across the world. The few studies on technical efficiency related to the agricultural sector performance in Zambia have not attempted to determine how technically efficient smallholder farmers that produce maize under minimum tillage are. This study used stochastic frontier analysis based on both the half-normal and exponential model distributions on 2008 cross-sectional nationally representative data of 160 smallholder maize farm households that adopted minimum tillage in Zambia. Results indicate that maize farmers face increasing returns to scale (1.074) implying that there were opportunities for them to improve their technical efficiency as they were operating in stage I of their production functions. The half-normal and exponential model distributions indicate average technical efficiency scores of 60 and 71.7 percent, respectively. Their respective lowest efficiency scores were 9.3 and 8.5 percent. The highest efficiency scores for the half-normal and exponential model distributions were 89.3 and 90.9 percent. Maximum likelihood estimation results show that marital status, level of education of household head, square of household size, off farm income, agro-ecological region III, distance to vehicular road and access to loans are statistically significant factors that affect technical efficiency of smallholder maize farmers that practice minimum tillage in Zambia. The study calls for increased infrastructural development through construction of improved road network, schools and colleges in remote areas as a means to increasing accesss to knowledge and other agricultural services in order to enhance their technical efficiency levels. It also recommends promotion of minimum tillage practices in recommended agro-ecological regions to improve their technical efficiency. The study further acclaims for increased access to loans by smallholder maize farmers that practice minimum tillage as this would in one way induce them to invest in improved varieties and equipment that would help enhance their technical efficiency in Zambia.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;The cropping system is an approach to help farmer in decision making to remain sustainable in an ever-changing agricultural environment. A two-year study was carried out at Ismailia Agricultural Experiments and Research Station, ARC, Ismailia governorate, Egypt during 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 seasons to study the effect of preceded peanut cultivars on yield and profitability of wheat under two cropping systems in sandy soil. This experiment included six treatments which were the combinations of three peanut cultivars (Giza 4, Giza 5 and Ismailia 1) as preceding cultivars in the summer season and two cropping systems (conventional and intensive). A split plot design replicated thrice was used. The results indicated that peanut cv. Ismailia 1 increased available soil nitrogen (N) content which affected positively number of grains per spike and grain weight per spike and finally the economic yield. Growing fahlberseem in transition period between peanut and wheat enhanced available soil N content that increased grain yield per ha by about 1.00 percent as compared with those of conventional cropping system. Accordingly, intensive cropping system increased wheat grain yield and its attributes as compared with conventional cropping system. Peanut cultivars × cropping systems interaction had a significant effect on available soil N content and all the studied wheat traits except number of spikes/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Intensive cropping system increased total and net returns as compared with conventional cropping system. The Egyptian farmers could achieve an increase in their income by $ 2603.2 per ha when using intensive cropping system which included peanut cv. Ismailia 1&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;A remarkable challenge lies in maximizing agricultural water productivity, particularly in the drought prone regions of sub Saharan Africa. It is hypothesized that water use efficiency (WUE) can be increased by selection of appropriate cropping management systems. This study seeks to establish the effects of cropping management on water use efficiency in cassava-sorghum cropping systems in the drylands of eastern Uganda. A randomised complete block design (RCBD) consisting of six treatments: sole cassava, sole sorghum, sole cowpea, cassava + sorghum, cassava + cowpea, and sorghum + cowpea, replicated three times were used. Two tillage practices; mouldboard ploughing (Mb) and, ripping (Rp) were used to assess the effect of tillage. WUE (kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; mm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) was calculated as a ratio of yield (kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) to evapotranspiration (ET) (mm). ET was estimated using the soil water balance. WUE varied significantly (?= 0.05) between cropping systems with the highest observed in cassava (34.38 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; mm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) while the lowest was 3.76 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; mm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for sorghum. WUE did not differ appreciably in both Mb and Rp tillage practices. Farmers growing sole cassava could use either of the tillage practices. The best yield was recorded in cassava + cowpea cropping system under Mb ploughing and sole sorghum under Rp gave the poorest combined yield (1,676 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;This study focused on the observed impact of switching from a corn / soybean agricultural rotation to the planting of warm season perennial grasses for use in biomass agriculture, as well as the subsequent effects on resident mammal populations. We trapped two parcels of land planted in warm season perennial grasses between September 2011 and October 2013 in order to obtain a census of the mammal populations residing upon the property and to determine the impact (if any) of the change in agriculture. During the first year of the study, a seemingly inhospitable (urban) agricultural area revealed a diverse population of inhabitants. The second year of trapping resulted in the capture of 2 new species (total of 7 species captured) and the noticeable absence of 1 species; a distinct shift in mammal populations had been observed. There was an inverse relationship between the population increase of &lt;em&gt;Peromyscus maniculatus&lt;/em&gt; during 2012 and the decline in the population of &lt;em&gt;Peromyscus leucopus. &lt;/em&gt;When a Chi-square test was run (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), the hypothesis of competitive exclusion appeared to be supported. In the third year, population numbers of &lt;em&gt;Peromyscus&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;maniculatus&lt;/em&gt; had also plummeted. We observed that warm season perennial grass monoculture had an adverse impact on resident mammal species.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;This study uses probit model to identify determinants of food insecurity among rural households in developing countries. The model used in this study, that allowed us to estimate coefficient and marginal effect for each independent variable vis-à-vis dependent variable, guarantees large applications among food security actors and policymakers to find out factors that significantly explain food insecurity and the level of their predictability. The ability of the model used to correctly classify food insecure and food secure households is good for the overall model and for households headed by males while it is fair for households headed by females. The empirical results show that rural households are more exposed to food insecurity than urban households. Gender disaggregation by the head of households shows that among food insecure rural households, the majority of them are headed by females. It also shows that the mean and median of predicted probability of becoming food insecure among rural households headed by males and females is 0.21 and 0.28 for mean and 0.15 and 0.24 for median respectively. This indicates that households headed by females are more likely exposed to food insecurity than those headed by males. However, as the majority of rural households in developing countries depend on agriculture, this study found that it is worthwhile for developing countries to adopt new agricultural technologies to urgently increase productivity and to implement and facilitate programs supporting rural households pathways to increase households’ livelihood capacities.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

								<abstract language="eng">&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted to address the issue of consumers’ willingness to pay for inclusion of cassava flour in bread in Lagos State. The data were collected randomly from a sample of 300 respondents in the state through the use of a well structured questionnaire. The contingent valuation method was adopted to estimate both the mean willingness to pay of consumers and the factors that affect their willingness to pay and these were analyzed using the bivariate probit model. The most significant model was the 10percent cassava flour inclusion as it has the highest number of significant variables (eight) followed by 20percent cassava flour inclusion with seven significant variables and 30 and 40percent cassava flour inclusion with six significant variables each. The factors that influenced consumers’ willingness to pay for CCW bread were the respondent’s age, gender, respondents’ awareness, married respondents, respondents with head position&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt;and bread share which is the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;proportion of respondents income spent on bread to total income. The mean willingness to pay for bread with an inclusion of cassava flour at 10, 20, 30, and 40percent cassava flour inclusion were ?172.70, ?165.00, ?154.07, and ?142.78 respectively for initial bid while the mean willingness-to-pay at 10, 20, 30, and 40percent cassava flour inclusion were ?180.20, ?150.41, ?143.35, and ?127.36 respectively for subsequent bid. Arising from the result of this study, birth control policies were recommended among respondents in the study area.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
