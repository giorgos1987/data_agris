with Atlantic bluefin tuna, survival was a challenging&#13;
issue. As bacterial colonization of the gut&#13;
has been shown to play a key role for other species,&#13;
we studied the profiles of the microbiota associated&#13;
with individual larvae at different stages in&#13;
three distant hatcheries. The Bacterial Community&#13;
Profile (BCP) was quantified based on PCR-DGGE&#13;
analyses of partial amplicons from 16S rDNA.&#13;
Considerable individual variability in BCP was&#13;
observed before onset of feeding, and the BCP did&#13;
not show regular fluctuation during ontogenesis.&#13;
Microalgae were added to the rearing tanks in two&#13;
of the three hatcheries, but it was not possible to&#13;
distinguish the effect of location from the effect of&#13;
algal addition on BCP. In one hatchery, the larvae&#13;
were reared either with algal addition or in mesocosm,&#13;
but due to high individual variability, no&#13;
significant difference in BCP was detected between&#13;
the two groups. It was hypothesized that this variability&#13;
was caused by differences in health, physiological&#13;
status and developmental stage of the&#13;
larvae. A practical conclusion from the study is&#13;
the need to analyse a considerable number of individuals&#13;
to reflect statistically significant differences&#13;
between the microbial communities associated&#13;
with rearing groups.</dc:description><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10508/2482</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Aquaculture Research, 44. 2013: 1511-1523</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>doi:10.1111/j.1365-2109.2012.03158.x</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>20271</dc:identifier><dc:type>article</dc:type><ags:rightsTermsOfUse>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/es/</ags:rightsTermsOfUse><ags:rightsTermsOfUse>embargoedAccess</ags:rightsTermsOfUse><ags:rightsTermsOfUse>Atribución-NoComercial-SinDerivadas 3.0 España</ags:rightsTermsOfUse></ags:resource></ags:resources>
