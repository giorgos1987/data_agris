These indices were calculated for individual populations (intrinsic population rate of growth and mean length) and for all the community (ABC curves, indices about faunal diversity, proportion of non-commercial species, mean length in community and size spectra). We use the data of twenty five species caught in the survey along the years, included Northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis). The data of Northern shrimp, capelin (Mallotus villosus) and Northern sand lance (Ammodytes dubius) have a great influence in the value of the indices, as their abundance is very high in relation to their contribution to the biomass. The indices present a general stable pattern with a slight improvement in recent years. After two decades of moratorium, yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea) seems to be recovered and other important commercial species as Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides) begin to recover in the South of the Grand Banks.</dc:description><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10508/1717</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>NAFO Scientific Council Research (SCR) Documents, NAFO SCR Doc. 13/014 Serial Nº N6165. 2013: 1-27</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>6569</dc:identifier><dc:type>article</dc:type><ags:rightsTermsOfUse>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/es/</ags:rightsTermsOfUse><ags:rightsTermsOfUse>openAccess</ags:rightsTermsOfUse><ags:rightsTermsOfUse>Atribución-NoComercial-SinDerivadas 3.0 España</ags:rightsTermsOfUse></ags:resource></ags:resources>
