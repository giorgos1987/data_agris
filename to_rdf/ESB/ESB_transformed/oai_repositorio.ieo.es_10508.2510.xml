a class of global flame retardants whose residues have&#13;
markedly increased in fish and human tissues during the&#13;
last decade. They belong to persistent and toxic contaminants&#13;
which needmore attention and toxicological study&#13;
as their degradation in the environment is not well understood.&#13;
This study characterizes 2,2′,4,4′-&#13;
tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47) bioconcentration,&#13;
elimination and biotransformation in juvenile turbot&#13;
Psetta maxima, in order to evaluate the risk of its bioaccumulation&#13;
in the marine environment. During this study, juvenile turbot were exposed to environmentally&#13;
relevant BDE-47 concentrations from 0.001 to 1 μg/L&#13;
for 16 days via aqueous exposure. This study found that juvenile turbot bioconcentrated and biotransformed&#13;
BDE-47. There was no difference in standard length or&#13;
weight between control and exposed fish. Uptake and&#13;
elimination of BDE-47 by the turbot during exposure&#13;
were examined in controlled laboratory experiments.&#13;
Bioconcentration of BDE-47 was similar in fish from&#13;
all treatment groups. Bioconcentration was rapid and increased with exposure time, since the bioconcentration&#13;
factor (BCF) was higher. However, elimination was&#13;
slower in comparison and low elimination was detected&#13;
after 10 days in clean water. BDE-47 concentration in&#13;
water influences the BCF. Half-life ranged between 37&#13;
and 108 days and theoretical times t90 could range from&#13;
120 to 358 days. The present study demonstrates a&#13;
stepwise debromination of BDE-47 to BDE-28.</dc:description><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10508/2510</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Water Air Soil Pollution, 225. 2014: 1-12</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.1007/s11270-014-2072-0</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>20291</dc:identifier><dc:type>article</dc:type><ags:rightsTermsOfUse>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/es/</ags:rightsTermsOfUse><ags:rightsTermsOfUse>embargoedAccess</ags:rightsTermsOfUse><ags:rightsTermsOfUse>Atribución-NoComercial-SinDerivadas 3.0 España</ags:rightsTermsOfUse></ags:resource></ags:resources>
