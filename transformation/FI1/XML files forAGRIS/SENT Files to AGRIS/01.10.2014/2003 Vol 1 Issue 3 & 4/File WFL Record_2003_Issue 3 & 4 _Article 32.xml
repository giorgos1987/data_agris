    <abstract>Demand for pesticides, inorganic and organic fertilizers were jointly estimated using survey data from 81 randomly selected ‘contract hybrid vegetable and cereal seed growers’ in northwestern Bangladesh, applying a simultaneous equation framework. Pesticide cost accounts for 6.9 % of the gross value of output in hybrid vegetable seeds and 3.2% in cereals. About 87% of farmers used pesticides at least once with mean number of applications 4.4. Twenty-five brands of pesticides were used including a substantial number of banned pesticides. Price elasticity of demand for pesticides, fertilizers and biofertilizers were estimated at -0.83, -0.21 and -1.13, respectively. Farmers treat chemical fertilizers and pesticides as complements since the demand for fertilizer decreases when pesticide price increase. On the other hand, increase in prices of both vegetable and cereal seeds significantly increases pesticide demand. Farmers who use a facemask as a precaution during pesticide application apply a significantly higher amount of all three inputs. Farmers’ level of education and experience significantly reduce pesticide use. The analysis suggests that farmers’ welfare could be safeguarded by raising awareness, promoting education and implementing pesticide regulations effectively.</abstract>
