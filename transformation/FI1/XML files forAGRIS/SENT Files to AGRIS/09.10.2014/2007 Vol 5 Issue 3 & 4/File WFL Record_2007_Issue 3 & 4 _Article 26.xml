    <abstract>To extend shelf life, the effects of light on postharvest quality of Brussels sprouts and broccoli were studied. Light sources were day light of fluorescence lamps of 1300 lux (L) or 3500 lux (A). The lamps were placed 70 cm above the samples in cold room set at 5oC temperature and 85-90% relative humidity (RH). Black covering material was used to prevent the entering of light from other sources. Control group (K) of samples was not illuminated and stored in dark. Length of the storage experiment was 21 days. During this period, samples were removed every 7th day to determine visual quality, weight loss, surface colour and chlorophyll content. Leaf yellowing of Brussels sprouts was reduced by light but yellowing was induced in broccoli due to opening of florets. Thus, light exposure only improved performance and shelf life of Brussels sprouts.</abstract>
