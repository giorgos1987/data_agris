ern and western populations. Here, we evaluated migratory and homing behaviors of bluefin tuna&#13;
in several regions of the North Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea using chemical tags (&#13;

line’ (45° W management boundary) in the Central North Atlantic Ocean and mixing with the&#13;
other population. Several western migrants were also detected in Moroccan traps off the coast of&#13;
Africa, indicating that trans-Atlantic movement occurs for members of the western population;&#13;
however, the degree of mixing declined with proximity to the eastern spawning area (Mediterran-&#13;
ean Sea). The origin of bluefin tuna collected at the entrance to the Strait of Gibraltar and from&#13;
several regions within the Mediterranean Sea (Balearic Islands, Malta, and Sardinia) was essen-&#13;
tially 100% eastern fish, demonstrating that natal homing is well developed by the eastern popu-&#13;
lation, with western migrants rarely entering the Mediterranean Sea.</dc:description><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10508/2588</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Marine Ecology Progress-Series, 504. 2014: 265-276</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>20341</dc:identifier><dc:type>article</dc:type><ags:rightsTermsOfUse>embargoedAccess</ags:rightsTermsOfUse></ags:resource></ags:resources>
