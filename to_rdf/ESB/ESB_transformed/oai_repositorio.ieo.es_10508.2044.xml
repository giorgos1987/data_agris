among ectothermic organisms, and any traits induced early&#13;
in ontogeny may have long-term effects. Here, we studied&#13;
how turbot larvae altered their morphology in three different&#13;
thermal environments and assessed whether different thermal&#13;
regimes affected the survival, growth, development and morphology&#13;
of juvenile turbot at the end of metamorphosis.&#13;
Therefore, newly hatched Turbot (Scopthalmus maximux L.)&#13;
larvae were divided into three groups and reared at 14, 18&#13;
and 22°C until 80 days after hatching. Environmental temperature&#13;
was seen to affect several turbot traits. Low temperature&#13;
induced low dorsal and anal fin ray counts, but had no&#13;
effect on gross body morphology. There were differences in&#13;
growth and skeletal development rates, but no differences in&#13;
survival. There were also no differences in the skeletal malformations&#13;
occurring in response to environmental temperature&#13;
treatment. Collectively, these results supported the idea&#13;
of the existence of a thermal plastic response, as found, in&#13;
other fish species</dc:description><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10508/2044</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Applied Ichthyology, 30. 2014: 762-766</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.1111/jai.12535</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>20011</dc:identifier><dc:type>article</dc:type><ags:rightsTermsOfUse>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/es/</ags:rightsTermsOfUse><ags:rightsTermsOfUse>restrictedAccess</ags:rightsTermsOfUse><ags:rightsTermsOfUse>Atribución-NoComercial-SinDerivadas 3.0 España</ags:rightsTermsOfUse></ags:resource></ags:resources>
