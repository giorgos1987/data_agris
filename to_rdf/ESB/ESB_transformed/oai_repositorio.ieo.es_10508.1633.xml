to carry out an otolith exchange programme to solve the&#13;
ageing problems pointed out by ACFM.&#13;
A sample of 115 otoliths from Division IXa was exchanged, and&#13;
seven countries are taking part in the exchange, although it&#13;
has not yet been completed. One otolith from each fish was&#13;
sectioned and the other preserved in aqueous solution. In&#13;
the whole otoliths a tendency to lose one or two early rings&#13;
was observed, and in the sectioned otoliths the presence of&#13;
false rings was the cause of misreading. A combination of&#13;
both methods would probably improve the age determinations,&#13;
but is unfortunately time consuming.&#13;
The agreement between the readers was in general low, from&#13;
both sliced and whole otoliths.The ANOVA with a significance&#13;
level of 5% showed that the mean age of the sample is&#13;
different for various readers, and the Tukey test showed that&#13;
there are no significant differences between three readers,&#13;
at the same significance level.&#13;
Considering the importance of ageing in the .assessment, new&#13;
investigations are needed to improve the agreement, and it is&#13;
suggested that further samples are exchanged, or that an&#13;
otolith workshop should be convened.</dc:description><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10508/1633</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Meixide, M. 1990. Results of the blue whiting otolith exchange.
