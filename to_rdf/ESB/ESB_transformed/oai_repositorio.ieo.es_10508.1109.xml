Significant differences between the groups were found, which were determined through a MANOVA with a design of repeated measurements, being p&lt;O.OOl for all groups. Those which presented higher growth ingested a dose of 300 mg of l-Carnitine and those presenting lower growth ingested fat (16% of dry food), without any other factors added. &#13;
&#13;
The protein and lipid content analyses in carcass and liver showa difference of fat accumulation, with values varying from 7 to 20% of humid weight for those treated with l-Carnitine, ó-tocopherol, and fat respectively according to treatment.</dc:description><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10508/1109</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Int.Counc.Exp.Sea(ICES) DF,1992/G:81</dc:identifier><dc:type>article</dc:type><dc:type>other</dc:type></ags:resource></ags:resources>
