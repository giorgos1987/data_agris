    <abstract>This paper reviews the period between 1992 and 2000 when the National Agricultural Land Development Authority (NALDA) intervened in the agricultural development of Nigeria. During the period of operation, remarkable progress was noticed in the performance of agricultural sector. More lands were opened up and cultivated within a short time compared to what used to happen in the past. However, weaknesses that require special attention for better performance of agriculture and their sustainability were identified and highlighted. These include the area of fund release to agricultural programme, inputs sourcing and purchase, machinery acquisition and repairs, training of programme staff and programme publicity. The review exposed areas of challenges for the future of agriculture in Nigeria as the consolidation of fragmented farmers’ holdings into contiguous farm lands and organizing farmers into co-operative group to enhance credit sourcing and farmer training respectively. Other areas include the reactivation of the Nigeria produce marketing board as a way of standardizing the agricultural produce for better foreign exchange earnings of the country and improving the standard of living of the farmers.</abstract>
