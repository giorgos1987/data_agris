caused severe effects in the seafloor morphology and substrate composition (e.g. lava extrussion and&#13;
construction of the volcanic edifice), the water column (e.g. acidification, deoxygenation and fertilization)&#13;
and the biological communities (e.g. changes in the composition and functioning of communities)&#13;
(Fraile-Nuez et al. 2012; Santana-Casiano et al. 2013). Due to this natural event, habitats and associated&#13;
biota have experimented changes at different levels and in different parts of this new seafloor volcanic&#13;
structure. Underwater images obtained with VOR Aphia 2012 (October 2013) and ROV Liropus 2000&#13;
(March 2014) as well as samples collected with a benthic dredge in March and October 2013 have made&#13;
possible the study of the benthic and demersal organisms that persisted after this acute natural event as&#13;
well as those that are recolonizing the recently formed volcanic bottoms.&#13;
During the eruption, material of variable size and texture buried previous existing habitats and associated&#13;
biota, except in certain bathyal bottoms close to the base of this new seafloor structure (200 - 500 m&#13;
depth) where slow-growing suspension-feeders such as antipatharians (e.g. Stichopathes cf. gracilis, Antipathes&#13;
furcata), small gorgonians (e.g. Acanthogorgia, Bebryce) and lithistid sponges still increase the&#13;
bottom complexity when compared to those buried bottoms. Among them, small colonies of cold-water&#13;
corals (probably Dendrophyllia cornigera and Cladocora debilis) also occur, but mostly represented by&#13;
dead specimens. In both March and October 2013, benthic dredge samples collected lava rocks and&#13;
gravels that were poorly colonized by invertebrates, together with remains of antipatharians and dead&#13;
cold-water corals. In shallower parts of the flanks of the volcano (ca. 200m depth), most previously&#13;
existing habitats formed by antipatharians have been buried after the eruptive processes and the recent&#13;
lava rocks are starting to be colonized by small and scarce colonies of hydrozoans, serpulids and small&#13;
size echinoids (e.g. Coelopleurus floridianus), among other species. Nevertheless, the gravel bottoms&#13;
at this bathimetric level display a higher degree of colonization, with higher abundances of polychaetes&#13;
(e.g. Glyceridae, Polynoidae), decapods (e.g. Alpheus spp., Heterocrypta maltzami) and some molluscs&#13;
(e.g. Nassaridae), probably linked to previous succesful recruitment events or horizontal movements&#13;
from adjacent unimpacted bottoms. The fish Anthias anthias and the decapod P. narval are two of the&#13;
top dominant demersal organisms that have recolonized this area after the eruption.&#13;
Close to the summit, one of the top-dominant sessile macroinvertebrates is the oyster Neopycnodonte&#13;
cochlear, which occurs at densities of more than 100 indiv. m&#1048576;�2 in some of the large lava rocks and&#13;
represent one of the first sessile colonizers of the lava erupted by the vulcano. This filter feeder is also&#13;
very abundant on black-corals and undisturbed hard substrates located nearby at similar depths and may&#13;
have benefited from the new micro-habitats available in the hard bottoms formed and the fertilization&#13;
process after the eruptive event. In general, a pattern of decreasing species richness of benthic-demersal organisms has been found from&#13;
close to the summit to the base of the volcano, where the low colonization rate is a result of the lower&#13;
number of potential species that are able to recolonize these substrates, the specific biological features&#13;
of these species (e.g. slow growth rates, small reproductive outputs) and the oligotrophic character of&#13;
the water masses when compared to the summit. The findings highlight that the volcanic eruption firstly&#13;
buried most previously existing habitats and later on created a highly unstable and corrosive environment&#13;
that affected some slow-growing organisms (e.g. cold-water corals) but not others (e.g. antipatharians).&#13;
Nevertheless, the eruption provided nutrients that are important for primary pelagic production that may&#13;
have also promoted the establishment of dense populations of some sessile suspension feeders (e.g. N.&#13;
cochlear, hydrozoans) in the newly formed hard substrates.&#13;
