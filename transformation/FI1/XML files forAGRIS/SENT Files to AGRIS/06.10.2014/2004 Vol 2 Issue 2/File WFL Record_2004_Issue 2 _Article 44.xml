    <abstract>Laboratory experiments were conducted to assess the damages caused by Sitophilus oryzea Motsc on stored maize (Zea mais L.) grains in Calabar, Cross River State, Nigeria. Processed cardamon (Aframomum melegueta Thorn (K) and Schum) and black pepper (Piper guineensis Schum and Thorn) powder (applied at 5%) were used as protectants on 50 g stored maize grains (wt/wt). The grains were infested with 5, 10 and 15 population of adult weevils respectively. Sterilised grains (with no test plant powders and no weevils) 50 g were included to serve as control. The grains that were treated with the plant powders had significantly (P&lt;0.05) lower weight loss (8.95±0.2–13.62±0.34%) than the untreated grains (26.55±0.16–56.68±0.53%). The weight loss of the sterilised grains was 4.60±0.14-4.92±0.42%. The treated grains had 0-1.25±0.22% exit holes while the untreated grains had 2.25±0.22–3.50±0.56%. No exit holes were observed on the sterilised grains. The sterilised grains as well as the treated grains that were infested with 5 weevils had between 97.5±2.17-100% germination while the untreated ones did not germinate at all.</abstract>
