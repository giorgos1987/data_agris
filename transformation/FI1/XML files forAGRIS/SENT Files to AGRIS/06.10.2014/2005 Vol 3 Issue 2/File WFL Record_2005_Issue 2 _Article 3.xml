    <abstract>The functional properties; bulk density, water and oil absorption capacities, emulsion capacity and stability, foam capacity and stability including protein solubility of raw, boiled, roasted and autoclaved winged bean flours were determined. The results revealed that both the raw and processed flours were generally similar in bulk density and water/oil absorption capacities. Wettability was highest in the roasted winged bean flour (80.0 sec.), while the effect was minimal in others (12.0, 25.0 and 10.0 sec. respectively for raw, boiled and autoclaved flours). Emulsion capacity was highly reduced in the processed flours compared with the raw ones. The values were 4.02, 0.90, 2.17 and 2.06 ml/g respectively for raw, boiled, autoclaved and roasted flour. Foam capacity and stability were also lower in the processed samples. The results proved the usefulness of raw and processed winged bean flours as functional agents in food formations such as bakery products, whipped toppings, weaning foods, vegetable milk, etc.</abstract>
