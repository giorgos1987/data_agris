    <abstract>A retrospective study on the prevalence of pest of small ruminants (peste des petits ruminants) in Cross River State during 1996–1999 revealed that a total of 1981 animals were at risk with an annual mean of 495 animals. Out of the total animals at risk, 308 (15.55%) were sheep and 1,672 (84.4%) were goats, with an annual mean of 77 sheep and 418 goats respectively. Of the total animals at risk, 141 (7.11%) were sick and 124 (87.94%) died bringing the mean morbidity and mortality rates to 7.7 and 88.8% respectively. In the year 1996, a total of 331 animals were at risk, out of which 25 (7.55%) were sick and 22 (88%) of the infected animals died. In 1997, out of 894 animals at risk, 56 ( 6.26%) were sick and 49 (87.5%) died. In 1998, out of 330 animals at risk, 43 (13.03%) were sick and 37 (86.04%) died. In the year 1999, a total of 426 animals were at risk out of which 17 (3.99%) were sick and 16 (94.12%) died.</abstract>
